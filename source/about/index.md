Chatswood is the personal blog of Maurice Kelly -- that's me. I'm a software engineer and iOS developer by day, and a husband, father and musician by night.

After graduating from university in 2001, I spent 10 years of my life working for Openwave Systems (now Openwave Mobility) developing software for a number of service mediation product offerings. In time I felt like a career change, and picked up Xcode in order to become an iOS developer working for [GCD Technologies](http://www.gcdtech.com/).

While at university I took up writing for UK computing magazines PC Plus and Linux Format. I've never lost the writing bug and am currently awaiting the fruits of 6 months of hard work to be published.
