I don't get why [Facebook][] don't implement a two-tier friends system. You could call it *friends and family* or even *family and colleagues* or whatever. But having a way to restrict posts to a closer circle of friends would reduce the dilemma[^1] that the average person faces many times in their Facebook lives:

>Do I accept a friend request from my mum/dad/boss/colleague/teacher/whatever and risk getting in trouble for something I or my friends post, or do I ignore their friend request and risk the wrath incurred by doing so?
