For me this sums up everything that there is to being a dad. When the subject of bicycle helmets came up in the past, I always swore that I'd never wear one. I trotted out the old fallback position of "I never needed one when I was a kid, I don't need one now, and my kids will never need one either."

Now that I'm actually a dad, my position has changed. From here on I'll do whatever is necessary to set a good example for my daughter. How times changes.
