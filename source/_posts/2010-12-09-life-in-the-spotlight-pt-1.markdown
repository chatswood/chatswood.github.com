I'm sorry *Spotlight*.

I ignored you for so long. Occasionally I would step into you just for a moment to find a file that I misplaced, and once I'd used you I'd walk away, back into the darkness.

I truly feel bad for doing so.

But times change. People change. I change.

Now I realise that it's so much easier to launch Mac applications from you than from anywhere else[^1]. All I have to do is press *Cmd-Space*, start typing the application name, and more often than not after a couple of letters I can hit return and the application launches.

Life is so much easier now. And brighter.

Thank you Spotlight.

[^1]: Except from the D-O-C-K, but we don't mention him out loud in front of Spotlight.
