Continuing with the recent snow theme... being stuck in the house for a while inevitably leads me to idly browse the InterWebs in search of new things to buy[^1] that I don't really need.

Today I've been looking at snow blade attachments for the front of the ride-on mower which would convert it into a small scale snow plough. We've got a nice [Castelgarden][] mower and, lo-and-behold, Castelgarden produce the [snow blade][] you see above.

Unfortunately it's a bit late to be getting one (both time-wise and financially) but this is one purchase that could definitely be on the cards if the recent changes to our winters become more permanent. In the meantime it's back to the trusty new [snow shovel][].

[^1]: Thankfully my "accountant" prevents me from going through with 99% of these purchases.
