[Biker gang plunders Covent Garden Apple Store][]:

> Two men are being questioned by coppers after the "smash and grab" raid at 1am today, just days after the death of billionaire Apple baron Steve Jobs.

For some reason [The Register][] decided that a story about a smash and grab at a consumer electronics store needed a reminder about Steve Jobs passing away. But they couldn't just leave it at a simple reference - they had to point out that he was *"billionaire Apple Baron"*. I'm not sure of the relevance.

Unless of course the thieves took these facts into account...

*Thief 1: Dude we're hitting the Apple Store tonight.*

*Thief 2: Excellent! But wait. Steve Jobs only just died - wouldn't it be a little bit insensitive?*

*Thief 1: Nah! Sure he was a billionaire Apple baron - it's okay to rob from them.*
