There is fertile new ground for app developers - the successful funding of App.net last week and the availability of their API has opened up a new space for client developers. I'm personally trying out quite a number of these across the Web, iOS and OS X. Most of these clients have been released as alpha-quality software, which can be a mixed blessing.

Te definition of alpha-quality software varies from developer to developer, and even from user to user. Most developers and users can agree that alpha-quality software indicates a lack of maturity in a product - this could indicate a lack of stability or a lack of features. Running alpha software can lead to frustration for all parties involved.

Should users hold their tongue when they encounter problems.

Do they have the right to criticise.

Is alpha software out of bounds?



The benefits of criticism


If you release alpha software you should expect criticism, feedback, suggestions, feature requests.


"Very alpha" - some developers seem to feel that emphasizing the "alpha" nature will make users be more understanding about the lack of polish.

I got grief for complaining, when I didn't mention a specific app. 

"You're a developer - you understand the concept of an alpha version. They crash. So what are you complaining about?  Live with the crashes, or wait for a stable version."
