Samsung are bitching about the decision to ban sales of their Galaxy Tab 10.1 being upheld by a German court.

I love the fact that they say it limits consumer choice, completely ignoring the fact that by making a device so similar to the iPad that they reduced the buyers decision to purchasing an iPad or an inferior iPad clone.

Now that is severely limiting consumer choice.
