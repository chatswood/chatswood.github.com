There's been a lot of talk recently about the venerable [BBEdit][] from [Bare Bones][] reaching it's 20th birthday. It may have been easy to overlook the fact that it's younger, freer sibling [TextWrangler][] has just rolled over to version 4.0.

I'm a BBEdit user, but if I'm going to be working on someone else's Mac for whatever reason I'll quickly grab a copy of [TextWrangler][] to ensure that I'm in a somewhat familiar editing environment. So if you're needing BBEdit goodness, but are on a strict budget, then it's definitely worth grabbing TextWrangler from either the [Bare Bones site][TextWrangler], or from the [Mac App Store][].
