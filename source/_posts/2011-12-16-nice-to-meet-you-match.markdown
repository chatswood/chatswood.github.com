After a false start, iTunes Match became available in the UK, sooner than I expected. Judging by the image above, it could be a while before my collection is all sorted. I'm just glad I don't have my singles collection in there yet.

### One more thing...

I'd just like to see one teeny, tiny little addition to the service in future, which would really help my "ripping workflow". Currently when I buy a CD (yes, I still buy them) I take it out of the box, and stick it straight into the Mac to get ripped. I then tag the MP3s, back them up etc. It would be really nice if I could just stick in the CD and have iTunes detect it, *Match* the tracks, and let me download the tracks without ripping.

I suspect some would say that this would be open to abuse - a user could borrow a stack of CDs from their friend, and stick them in one by one to build up their own "legitimate" collection. In the end though, it only saves the time-consuming rip. Those people will probably just grab the audio files from their friend anyway.

So, come on Apple: just one more step to make life a little bit simpler.
