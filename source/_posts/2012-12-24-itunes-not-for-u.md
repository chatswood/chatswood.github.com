I can't figure out how to play **local** *iTunes U* content on my iPhone - it just doesn't appear on my device.

I like to download tutorial and training material (from sites like [Railscasts][], [iDeveloper TV][], [PeepCode][] and [Mijingo][]) and I'm one of these people who likes to hold onto the material *just in case* I ever need to watch it again. For convenience I dump it into iTunes on my Mac Mini that serves up content to a number of Apple TV and iOS devices. Because I've got a thing for organization, I like to mark the videos as being *iTunes U* material so that I can get to it easily through the Apple TV menus.

Sometimes I'm not using the Apple TV and I want to watch a quick tutorial on my iPhone. This happened the other night when I decided to watch a [Railscast][Railscasts]. So I opened up the *iTunes U* app on the iPhone. It gives me the option to get official material from the catalog, but doesn't let me browse my local Home Sharing machine.

So I tried the *Videos* app - it does let you choose Shared libraries, but only displays the categories *Movies*, *TV Shows*, and *Music Videos*. No sign of *iTunes U* content.

In desperation I tried the *Music* (formerly iPod) app but it didn't include the option for *iTunes U* content (and hasn't since *iTunes U* was split off into its own app a while back).

This seemed weird - I couldn't find a way to play iTunes U material stored on my local server. Strangely, when I picked up my iPad mini the Videos app there has a section for iTunes U material (and I was able to watch the [Railscast][Railscasts] absolutely fine - "panic" over).

Seems like quite an oversight that there is no way to carry out this (admittedly edge) use-case on an iPhone. Time for a Radar...
