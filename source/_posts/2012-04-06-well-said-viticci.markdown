> â€¦of all the people I have talked to in the past two years about the iPad no one ever asked me about a smaller version.

Federico Viticci [briefly responds][Ticci] to [MG Siegler's article *Seven*][Siegler].

I was surprised when Siegler wrote that people were saying they wished there was a smaller version of the iPad. I hang around with a lot of nerds, and even they haven't really been "wishing" for a smaller iPad until the [rumour mill started cranking recently][rumours].

Viticci's previous post on the subject sums it up for me when it comes to a 7.85" model - ["Why?"][Ticci previous]
