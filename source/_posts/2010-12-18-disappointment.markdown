Maybe it's just the child in me, but I can't help but feel disappointed that the flash weather warnings issued by the [Met Office][] for a heavy and disruptive snowfall did not materialise overnight. I have nothing to gain by seeing the entire country ravaged and paralysed by Arctic conditions but I'm going to be a little selfish here.

We'd done the hard yards:

* the heating oil tank was full;
* the coal bunker was full;
* the cars were filled with fuel for emergencies;
* the house was full of food (especially bread and milk);
* the fridge was full of beer and the cupboard full of crisps;
* Call of Duty: Black Ops and Rock Band 3 were ready to go.

We were ready for a weekend (or more) trapped in the house.

We'd been warned (though in my mind, I'd been *promised*) that we would be getting the kind of snow that would stop us from opening the doors to the house.

Last night's output - an inch of snow.

[Sigh...]
