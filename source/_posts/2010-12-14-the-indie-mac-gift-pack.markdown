The never-ending river of Mac software bundles continues to flow past me. My[^1] experience to date has always been the same: these bundles inevitably contain just one piece of software that I actually want or need, and a lot of extra filler that I'll never use.

But finally a bundle has come along that actually contains more than one application that I've been holding out for. That bundle is the [Indie Mac Gift Pack][].

Not only does it roll off the tongue, but for $60 I was able to pick up [Mars Edit][] and [Delicious Library 2][] - I was on the verge of buying both for a combined total of $80 so I'm very pleased to make a bit of a saving.

As usual there is still some filler however I may actually get some use out of some of them:

* *Acorn 2* - image editing software - I might finally be able to give up the horror that is The GIMP on OS X.
* *SousChef* - a recipe application which draws on a Internet-based repository of recipes.
* *RadioShift* - tool for recording Internet radio streams.
* *Sound Studio 4* - audio editor.
