I made the decision recently that I was going to stop buying physical media and make digital purchases *where possible*. By *where possible* I mean that I will buy the digital media under the following circumstances:

* when I can not buy a physical CD for a reasonable price;
* when I can get the digital media in a lossless format[^1].

The new album from Vince Clarke and Martin Gore (collectively known as [VCMG][]) was released today. I figured this was a good opportunity to try the new purchasing strategy and I decided to hop over to the [artist's page][] on mute.com to see about where to grab some digital goodness.

**Step 1** <br>
The obvious place to look is the mute.com store. A quick search for VCMG reveals that they have a *"Digital Album"* for sale. And only £6.99. I click the link, and see that the format is 320kbps MP3s. That's not what I'm looking for. Back to the artist page to try again.

**Step 2**<br>
While on the artist page, I notice a mention of VCMG's previous EP being available on [Beatport][]. Beatport is a site I've used before and has a good range of electronic and dance music. I head over there and search for VCMG. Result. It says £7.65 for the whole album so I add it to my basket. Hmmm, now there's VAT added. £8.80. Not so good. And it's only MP3. There is an option to upgrade to WAV but at a cost of £1 per track! THis brings the total cost to £20.30. I'll try elsewhere.

**Step 3**<br>
I head to Google and search for *vcmg ssss wav* and find the second result is Juno Download. They're upfront about pricing and show the options: 192kbps MP3, 320kbps MP3 and WAV. Their prices are fairly competitive for MP3s, but they still attract a £5.00 premium for WAV bringing the total price to £10.99. At nearly half the price of Beatport it is certainly an improvement, but it's not what I'd hoped for.

I do some more googling around using search terms such as *"vcmg ssss wav"*, *"vcmg ssss lossless"*, *"vcmg ssss flac"*. Much of what comes back is in the form of illegal torrents, so I decide to throw in the search modifier *"-torrent"*. Still I get mostly illegal download sources.

This dancing around the web has become boring now so I go old-school on the problem. I hit up Amazon and [bought the physical CD from there][Amazon]. For £8.99 I get the physical media and the ability to make FLAC and MP3 files from it. It's annoying, but it's still the best value out there.

[^1]: For now my preferred formats are WAV or FLAC. WAV files will be converted to FLAC for long term storage and the WAV files subsequently discarded.
