It dismays me to see how much of my tenners worth of fuel goes to the tax man. Would love to see a breakdown on how that fuel duty is actually used though.

I guess petrol is taxed as a luxury item, but for people who need it to get about (e.g. the disabled) surely it should have a lower rate of VAT?
