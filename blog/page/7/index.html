			Marco Arment on Chrome OS and IT Platform Longevity</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is an interesting commentary from <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Arment</a>. One thing that rang particularly true was this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“That’s why that PC on your banker’s desk is probably running Windows 2000, an  11-year-old platform: because it’s extraordinarily expensive to update it, and  the current system works acceptably without any massive, one-time expenditures  on this year’s budget.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why it doesn’t matter what kind of business I go into the person behind the desk/counter always seems to say <em>“I’m really sorry - the computers are running really slow today.”</em> A quick look at the screen or the box on/under the desk usually reveals the same thing - they are inevitably running an old OS on antiquated hardware.</p>

<p>To me this is why companies need to adopt something like Chrome OS - a lightweight, low-cost hardware platform using easily upgradeable software is the only way to combat the permanent “slow days” that cost everyone time without incurring the “massive, one-time expenditures” that Marco mentions.</p>

			Desktop Linux: The Dream Is Dead</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>At last - mainstream IT media is finally catching on to what I’ve been saying for the past 3 years.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong - I love Linux as a server OS, and I was a huge advocate of it as a desktop OS for a long time. I used to write tutorials and reviews for <a href="http://www.linuxformat.com/">Linux Format</a> magazine so I really put my money where my mouth was at the time.</p>

<p>But about 3 years ago, I realised that despite all my advocacy I was still spending more time configuring my Linux OS than I was being productive with it. At that point in time all I wanted was a UNIX-like OS that worked out of the box - no fiddling with drivers or arcane config files. That’s why I gave Mac OS X a blast and I haven’t looked back since.</p>

<p>OS X has it’s flaws, but compared to life with Linux it has been a breeze. I’ll concede that in the last 3 years desktop Linux has come along way, but I really do think it has missed the boat and I think it boils down to the following issues: </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>There are too many varieties of Linux distributions out there</em> - it’s too hard to know what distribution to use, especially for newcomers. Distributions all have different ways of doing things, and despite efforts to rectify the situation there’s no real standard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>There are too many competing software projects</em> - in a similar way to the distributions spreading their efforts too thin, projects like KDE and GNOME compete unnecessarily. Instead of combining their efforts to make a superb desktop environment, they continue to soldier on in parallel with each other - neither making any real headway.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>There are too many hardware variations to support</em> - the biggest problem Microsoft faces for Windows is maintaining compatibility with all the hardware variations out there. Windows gets a bad rap at times but considering how many machines it runs on it’s pretty remarkable really. Linux faces the same problem, but with one major disadvantage - Microsoft got a huge head start.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>On the server side, however, Linux is in my opinion the best OS out there. Maybe that’s what the Linux community should be focussing their efforts onto. Maybe if they rationalised the distros and created themselves a reference hardware platform they could totally own the server space. Then and only then should they start thinking about the desktop again.</p>

			Curse You iPad and Your Lack of Multi-user Support</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The iPad pisses me off. It’s such an amazing device, and it does just about everything I could wish for from such a revolution in computing. It always sounds contrived to say that the iPad has changed things but <em>it really has!</em> (Ooooh, that sounded contrived). My laptop rarely comes out of an evening anymore - most of my casual browsing, mail checking, tweeting, etc is done on the iPad. My wife is able to use it to make Skype calls, do the grocery shopping, keep an eye on Facebook.</p>

<p>But there is one area where the iPad just doesn’t cut it - as a multi-user device. In <a href="http://brianshall.com/content/communal-computing-ipad-changes-everything-again-because-tablets-are-designed-collaboration-">this article Brian Shall</a> extolls the virtues of the iPad as a communal, collaborative device. I say “to hell with that.”</p>

<p>Some might say<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that I’m a bit funny about sharing my stuff. I’m a private individual - despite having nothing to hide I’m still a little edgy about somebody else using my OS X login. So a single-user device like the iPad really winds me up. As I said, I’ve got nothing to hide. It’s the little things like the unread items badge on the Mail app. Only being able to sync one set of bookmarks from <a href="http://www.me.com/">MobileMe</a>. Sharing a Google search history because my wife is permanently signed into Gmail. Only one of us being able to use the excellent <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/reeder-for-ipad/id375661689?mt=8">Reeder for iPad</a>.</p>

<p>Some apps do work for multiple accounts - the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/uk/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8">Twitter</a> app is very handy in this respect. But it shouldn’t really fall onto the app developers to do this. One of the beauties of iOS apps is that they are completely sandboxed - each app has it’s own space to play about in, and it does not put any of its settings or documents outside of it’s space. Why then can’t Apple implement multi-user support. The sandbox for each app could contain a sub-directory for each user of the device.</p>

<p>Sure there’s going to be a bit of an overhead in managing multiple users, but it’s hardly the end of the world. And it could be optional - allow people to enable multi-user support only if they feel that they need it.</p>

<p>I’m sure Apple would rather that everyone in the family spent the £429/$499 to get a device each but that’s not going to happen. So until they bring the price down dramatically, or they implement multi-user support, it’s never going to be the true family device that it could be.</p>

			Daily Backups</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Following some hard disk wobbles in the last few weeks I decided to take a more rigorous approach to my backup strategy. I’ve been using <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> for some time now but my backups were infrequent to say the least. So I bit the bullet and set up a scheduled backup for myself to run every lunchtime when I was away from my desk.</p>

<p>After a couple of days I decided that wasn’t quite enough - what I really wanted was a backup at the end of the day to complement the lunchtime backup. However I’m too impatient to sit around waiting for a backup to complete when I could be hitting the road and avoiding rush hour traffic. So I went for the next best thing and went for a morning backup instead. Because my arrival time to work can vary a bit depending on morning traffic I simply enabled the <em>“When you connect [drive name] to your Macintosh”</em> option in <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> which allowed it to start as soon as my boot procedure finished and I’d attached the drive to the Mac.</p>

<p>This was working well, however it did leave me checking back occasionally to see when I could get started on some work. This is when <a href="http://prowl.weks.net/">Prowl</a> came to the rescue. Prowl is a fantastic <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/prowl-growl-client/id320876271?mt=8">iOS app</a> that receives notifications from my desktop applications and forwards them to my iOS device using Apple’s push notification service. Prowl receives these notifications from my Mac via it’s custom <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a> plugin - this plugin receives the Growl notifications and sends them to my account with Prowl (and also displays the notification to the computer screen).</p>

<p>Once <a href="http://prowl.weks.net/">Prowl</a> has sent the notification to my device I get a nice alert (as seen above) informing me that the backup has completed or failed (which has never happened to date thankfully). All of which means that I can continue to enjoy my breakfast until my iPhone alerts me to the fact that it’s time to get stuck into a days work.</p>

<p>Speaking of which…</p>

<p>I ignored you for so long. Occasionally I would step into you just for a moment to find a file that I misplaced, and once I’d used you I’d walk away, back into the darkness.</p>

<p>I truly feel bad for doing so.</p>

<p>Now I realise that it’s so much easier to launch Mac applications from you than from anywhere else<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.

			But Life Is Easy in Jail</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/35g1RdojcIv7HKBKOMypbf">Thin Lizzy - Jailbreak</a>
(Sorry - I couldn’t find Jailbreak by AC/DC on Spotify)</p>

<p>Despite the title this is not one of those rants about the state of prison life and how it’s a cushy number. This is about my lack of understanding about why people are so keen to “jailbreak” their iOS devices.</p>

<p>I’m iOSed up to the max - I’ve got an iPhone, and iPod Touch and an iPad, and all 3 of these devices are happy to live the easy life in Apple’s “jail”.</p>

<p>This morning I read the news that iOS 4.2.1 had been jailbroken and you could now do whatever it is that jailbreakers love to do. This got me intrigued again so I decided to have a look at the process involved to see how easy it is and whether or not it was worth giving it a go.</p>

<h2 id="why-bother">Why bother?</h2>

<p>So what is so good about a jailbroken device that drives the ordinary people - the <em>exploit consumers</em> - to follow the steps so meticulously laid out by the <em>exploit producers</em>. I’ve done a bit of reading about (nothing detailed though) and it seems to boil down to the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Allowing non-Apple approved software to be installed;</li>
  <li>Allowing the installation of pirated software;</li>
  <li>Allowing extra tweaks to to the OS.</li>
  <li>Allowing the phone to be used on alternative networks;</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="non-app-store-software">Non-App Store software</h3>

<p>This seems to be a big deal to a lot of people. To be fair many great iPhone/iOS apps started life on jailbroken iPhones before Apple launched the App Store. I don’t know if the App Store was always planned, or if it was a reaction to the burgeoning app development scene, but ultimately modern iOS users owe a debt of gratitude to the pioneers in the pre-App Store jailbreak scene.</p>

<p>There are alternative app stores out there (such as <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydia_(application)">Cydia</a></em>) which allow jailbreakees to install software that cannot be obtained through the official App Store. The reasons for software not being available in the official App Store vary, but they could include software rejected by Apple or software written by people who reject Apple’s policies.</p>

<p>One good reason for software not being available in the App Store is the use of private APIs. Apple have a lot of functionality that is not available via it’s officially sanctioned public APIs, and as ever there are people out there who want to push the limits of their software beyond want Apple will allow them to do so. Putting an app on a store like Cydia may allow them to get sales they are denied from official channels, or even to build a userbase before those APIs become publicly available.</p>

<h3 id="pirated-software">Pirated software</h3>

<p>The stock iOS ecosystem is not conducive to software piracy. Apple employs DRM techniques to prevent illegally acquired apps from being run on iOS devices so in order to run pirated software you have to jailbreak your device.</p>

<p>I just want to be clear - just because piracy requires jailbreaking, does not mean that jailbreaking is always done for the purposes of piracy. Some people use their jailbreaking powers for evil, but just as many (if not more) use their jailbreaking powers for good! Flame aversion completed.</p>

<p>The reasons for using pirated iOS software are probably as abundant as those for any type of software platform, but they generally run the gamut from <em>“I like to try before I buy”</em> to (the immoral-but-honest) <em>“I don’t want to pay for software if I can get it for free”</em>. Of course there are people out there who genuinely do try the pirated software, then buy it (I’ve actually done it myself). But these people are a tiny minority. Jailbreaking may not be illegal, but using pirated software is, and it’ll never wash with me as a reason to jailbreak.</p>

<p>And for those of you who insist on <em>“I like to try before I buy”</em> - that’s what the <em>Lite</em> versions on the official App Store are for!</p>

<h3 id="tweaking-the-os">Tweaking the OS</h3>

<p>Some people just love to customise the things they possess. They exist in all walks of life as well as software - they are the home improvement fanatics, the car-modders, the GNU-Linux enthusiasts, to name but a minuscule sample of them.</p>

<p>iPhone owners are no exception - there will always be the enthusiasts who want to get console access to their device. They want to tweak the home screen. They want to push the limits of the software they paid for. Unfortunately Apple don’t want to relinquish that much control of the device. It’s an ongoing debate as to how healthy this level of control that Apple wields over the devices is, but like it or not, it’s the rules.</p>

<p>Unless of course you jailbreak your device. Then all bets are off and if you (or someone else) can figure out how to change some aspect of iOS then you’re free to do so.</p>

<p>It’s hard to see fault with this - and in fact it has benefits to non-jailbreakers as well. Apple come up with many great ideas, but they usually make their money by implementing somebody else’s great idea instead. By pushing the boundaries with what can be achieved with the device, it’s fair to say that Apple can soak up the great ideas in the current generation of jailbroken devices and wring the sponge into the next generation of the OS.</p>

<h3 id="network-freedom">Network freedom</h3>

<p>To me this is one of the few good reasons to jailbreak an iOS device like an iPhone or 3G iPad. In many territories the network-enabled devices are locked to particular carriers which means that people have to suffer the particular characteristics of that carrier and their network. The prime example is obviously AT&amp;T in the US. They seem to suffer more than their fair share of network issues, and people seem keen to jailbreak their devices simply to move to a network with better</p>

<h2 id="too-much-bother">Too much bother?</h2>

<p>Maybe I’m just not understanding everything that is involved, but it seems that jailbreaking involves a lot of conditions and caveats. The ability to jailbreak is based on exploits in particularly software/firmware combinations.</p>

<p>I’ve got no problem with people trying to break these, especially if it gives Apple the heads up when it comes to vulnerabilities in their software. But it seems that the only reason they go to such trouble is so that they can jailbreak their devices. Obviously there’s the <em>“hacker/cracker”</em> mindset at work here - it doesn’t matter what the device/software/technology is - there will always be someone who will try to break it just for sport.</p>

<p>For the jailbreakee I see it as an awful lot of hassle depending on the particular jailbreak in question. The recent <em>“jailbreakme”</em> exploit seemed pretty convenient - go to a web page, device is jailbroken. Easy. Assuming you have a version of iOS that is vulnerable. And that it all works fine.</p>

<h2 id="will-i-bother">Will I bother?</h2>

<p>To be frank - no I really don’t have any reason to do so.</p>

<ol>
  <li>There is no software that is unavailable on the official App Store that I <em>need</em> to have on my devices. And while I’m not the worlds best iOS developer, if I truly needed an itch scratched, I think I could do it myself.</li>
  <li>I don’t want to run pirated software. Like I said in the article I have done so in the past <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but I really don’t feel any need to do so any more.</li>
  <li>I’m happy enough with the stock capabilities of the iOS platform - I don’t think there’s anything I’d like changed so much that I’d go-a-jailbreakin’ just to get it.</li>
  <li>I’m lucky enough to live in a territory that has iPhones on multiple carriers and my carrier was kind enough to unlock mine when I asked them to.</li>
</ol>

<p>For now jailbreaking just doesn’t have a <em>killer app</em> for me. Maybe someday it will, but for now I’m content to stay in the Apple cell.</p>

		<p>A nice man from BT Wholesale called me yesterday to let me know what the deal was with us being able to get their <a href="http://www.bt.com/infinity">Infinity</a> product.</p>

<p>I’d been asking about when their Fibre To The Cabinet (FTTC) rollout was going to hit my local cabinet. The cabinet is at the end of the road, and I’d recently seen BT’s contractor (KN Networks) doing some work at it, but the physical cabinet had never arrived.</p>

<p>The good news from the call was that our humble abode is actually on another cabinet which is already FTTC-enabled. A mini-Mexican Wave was performed to the amusement of passers by.</p>

<p>The bad news was still to come - unfortunately the cabinet we’re actually connected to is much further away from the house and so we are over the 2km limit that BT are putting on their Infinity service.</p>

<p>Amazingly this wasn’t as devastating as I thought it would be. I looked around me, and it seemed like the world was still spinning. I suppose there are things in life that change your perspective and some of those have happened in the last year or so.</p>

<p>Still, I would love to get my hands on a faster broadband connection - 5.5Mbps is still a reasonable download speed, but I’m crying out for more upload! 0.4Mbps is just not enough to really live “in the cloud”.</p>
