  <div class="entry-content"><p>Setting aside the geeky shame in admitting it, I’m quite excited to see the launch of the new Mac App Store this Thursday (6th January).</p>

<h2 id="excitement">Excitement</h2>

<p>I’m excited about it for a number of reasons but the main reason is how it restores the process of shopping for software to the way I remember it to be. I remember the pre-Internet days of buying software - I used to take my pocket money to the local computer store and peruse the shelves for games and other software that would take my fancy.</p>

<p>The Internet revolutionised the way companies distributed software and the way consumers bought software, but to me it didn’t completely improve upon the original process. Sure, you no longer had to trudge to the shop (in inclement weather or fair) in order to see what was available. The downside was that the huge range available and the lack of a centralised distribution point made it harder to truly browse for new software.</p>

<p>The App Store changed this for iOS, and the Mac App Store will hopefully do the same for Mac OS X. I’m looking forward to being able to browse categories for new software and especially to a centralised update mechanism for software. I’m particularly interested to see how it fares with new and less experienced Mac users.</p>

<h2 id="trepidation">Trepidation</h2>

<p>I’ll say it up front: with anything that Apple control, there’s always going to be a risk of a censored view of the world. They are already the law when it comes to iOS apps, and they will also be the same for everything sold in the Mac App Store. Thankfully, side-loading is not prohibited with OS X the way it is on iOS so developers who cannot pass Apple’s stringent controls can still offer their apps for sale through their own channels.</p>

<p>I’m also concerned about how Apple are going to handle some aspects such as multi-user systems. At present I (begrudgingly) share my Macs with my wife, and when I buy a piece of software and install it, my wife is licensed to use it also. Apple have said that software bought from a Mac App Store account will be usable on other Macs tied to the same account. What they haven’t said is whether the Mac App Store account applies to the whole Mac, or if it is tied to the Apple ID only.</p>

<p>For me this could really make or break the new Mac App Store. I’ll still scour the Internet for independently licensed software rather than pay twice for 2 users to use the software on the same Mac.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing with the recent snow theme… being stuck in the house for a while inevitably leads me to idly browse the InterWebs in search of new things to buy<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that I don’t really need.</p>

<p>Today I’ve been looking at snow blade attachments for the front of the ride-on mower which would convert it into a small scale snow plough. We’ve got a nice <a href="http://www.castelgarden.com/">Castelgarden</a> mower and, lo-and-behold, Castelgarden produce the <a href="http://products.castelgarden.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=17203&amp;catalogId=13551&amp;productId=218135&amp;categoryId=66858&amp;topCategoryId=55904">snow blade</a> you see above.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it’s a bit late to be getting one (both time-wise and financially) but this is one purchase that could definitely be on the cards if the recent changes to our winters become more permanent. In the meantime it’s back to the trusty new <a href="http://blog.chatswood.org.uk/post/2349788295/shovel">snow shovel</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Maybe it’s just the child in me, but I can’t help but feel disappointed that the flash weather warnings issued by the <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/">Met Office</a> for a heavy and disruptive snowfall did not materialise overnight. I have nothing to gain by seeing the entire country ravaged and paralysed by Arctic conditions but I’m going to be a little selfish here.</p>

<p>We’d done the hard yards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the heating oil tank was full;</li>
  <li>the coal bunker was full;</li>
  <li>the cars were filled with fuel for emergencies;</li>
  <li>the house was full of food (especially bread and milk);</li>
  <li>the fridge was full of beer and the cupboard full of crisps;</li>
  <li>Call of Duty: Black Ops and Rock Band 3 were ready to go.</li>
</ul>

<p>We were ready for a weekend (or more) trapped in the house.</p>

<p>We’d been warned (though in my mind, I’d been <em>promised</em>) that we would be getting the kind of snow that would stop us from opening the doors to the house.</p>

<p>Last night’s output - an inch of snow.</p>

<p>[Sigh…]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love this article. Personally I think it’s either:</p>

<ol>
  <li>comedy gold - the author has really made an effort to come across as idiotic as possible;</li>
  <li>idiotic - the author has got no clue about computers, which makes this comedy gold.</li>
</ol>

<p>My personal highlight:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To make the Mac [Thunderbird] program livable, I increased the font to 16 point, then continued writing emails to military sources. That night, at 3:30 a.m., I awoke up with a disturbing realization. On my high-resolution iMac my 16-point lettering may have looked like normal size, but to the officials now receiving my letters, my emails must have looked like they were scribbled in the balloon-type of an eighth grade amateur.”</p>

<p>Genius. Or idiocy. Or genius. Or idiocy. Argh - can’t decide!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The never-ending river of Mac software bundles continues to flow past me. My<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> experience to date has always been the same: these bundles inevitably contain just one piece of software that I actually want or need, and a lot of extra filler that I’ll never use.</p>

<p>But finally a bundle has come along that actually contains more than one application that I’ve been holding out for. That bundle is the <a href="https://indiemacgiftpack.com/">Indie Mac Gift Pack</a>.</p>

<p>Not only does it roll off the tongue, but for $60 I was able to pick up <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">Mars Edit</a> and <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library 2</a> - I was on the verge of buying both for a combined total of $80 so I’m very pleased to make a bit of a saving.</p>

<p>As usual there is still some filler however I may actually get some use out of some of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Acorn 2</em> - image editing software - I might finally be able to give up the horror that is The GIMP on OS X.</li>
  <li><em>SousChef</em> - a recipe application which draws on a Internet-based repository of recipes.</li>
  <li><em>RadioShift</em> - tool for recording Internet radio streams.</li>
  <li><em>Sound Studio 4</em> - audio editor.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is an interesting commentary from <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Arment</a>. One thing that rang particularly true was this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“That’s why that PC on your banker’s desk is probably running Windows 2000, an  11-year-old platform: because it’s extraordinarily expensive to update it, and  the current system works acceptably without any massive, one-time expenditures  on this year’s budget.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why it doesn’t matter what kind of business I go into the person behind the desk/counter always seems to say <em>“I’m really sorry - the computers are running really slow today.”</em> A quick look at the screen or the box on/under the desk usually reveals the same thing - they are inevitably running an old OS on antiquated hardware.</p>

<p>To me this is why companies need to adopt something like Chrome OS - a lightweight, low-cost hardware platform using easily upgradeable software is the only way to combat the permanent “slow days” that cost everyone time without incurring the “massive, one-time expenditures” that Marco mentions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At last - mainstream IT media is finally catching on to what I’ve been saying for the past 3 years.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong - I love Linux as a server OS, and I was a huge advocate of it as a desktop OS for a long time. I used to write tutorials and reviews for <a href="http://www.linuxformat.com/">Linux Format</a> magazine so I really put my money where my mouth was at the time.</p>

<p>But about 3 years ago, I realised that despite all my advocacy I was still spending more time configuring my Linux OS than I was being productive with it. At that point in time all I wanted was a UNIX-like OS that worked out of the box - no fiddling with drivers or arcane config files. That’s why I gave Mac OS X a blast and I haven’t looked back since.</p>

<p>OS X has it’s flaws, but compared to life with Linux it has been a breeze. I’ll concede that in the last 3 years desktop Linux has come along way, but I really do think it has missed the boat and I think it boils down to the following issues: </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>There are too many varieties of Linux distributions out there</em> - it’s too hard to know what distribution to use, especially for newcomers. Distributions all have different ways of doing things, and despite efforts to rectify the situation there’s no real standard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>There are too many competing software projects</em> - in a similar way to the distributions spreading their efforts too thin, projects like KDE and GNOME compete unnecessarily. Instead of combining their efforts to make a superb desktop environment, they continue to soldier on in parallel with each other - neither making any real headway.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>There are too many hardware variations to support</em> - the biggest problem Microsoft faces for Windows is maintaining compatibility with all the hardware variations out there. Windows gets a bad rap at times but considering how many machines it runs on it’s pretty remarkable really. Linux faces the same problem, but with one major disadvantage - Microsoft got a huge head start.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>On the server side, however, Linux is in my opinion the best OS out there. Maybe that’s what the Linux community should be focussing their efforts onto. Maybe if they rationalised the distros and created themselves a reference hardware platform they could totally own the server space. Then and only then should they start thinking about the desktop again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The iPad pisses me off. It’s such an amazing device, and it does just about everything I could wish for from such a revolution in computing. It always sounds contrived to say that the iPad has changed things but <em>it really has!</em> (Ooooh, that sounded contrived). My laptop rarely comes out of an evening anymore - most of my casual browsing, mail checking, tweeting, etc is done on the iPad. My wife is able to use it to make Skype calls, do the grocery shopping, keep an eye on Facebook.</p>

<p>But there is one area where the iPad just doesn’t cut it - as a multi-user device. In <a href="http://brianshall.com/content/communal-computing-ipad-changes-everything-again-because-tablets-are-designed-collaboration-">this article Brian Shall</a> extolls the virtues of the iPad as a communal, collaborative device. I say “to hell with that.”</p>

<p>Some might say<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that I’m a bit funny about sharing my stuff. I’m a private individual - despite having nothing to hide I’m still a little edgy about somebody else using my OS X login. So a single-user device like the iPad really winds me up. As I said, I’ve got nothing to hide. It’s the little things like the unread items badge on the Mail app. Only being able to sync one set of bookmarks from <a href="http://www.me.com/">MobileMe</a>. Sharing a Google search history because my wife is permanently signed into Gmail. Only one of us being able to use the excellent <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/reeder-for-ipad/id375661689?mt=8">Reeder for iPad</a>.</p>

<p>Some apps do work for multiple accounts - the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/uk/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8">Twitter</a> app is very handy in this respect. But it shouldn’t really fall onto the app developers to do this. One of the beauties of iOS apps is that they are completely sandboxed - each app has it’s own space to play about in, and it does not put any of its settings or documents outside of it’s space. Why then can’t Apple implement multi-user support. The sandbox for each app could contain a sub-directory for each user of the device.</p>

<p>Sure there’s going to be a bit of an overhead in managing multiple users, but it’s hardly the end of the world. And it could be optional - allow people to enable multi-user support only if they feel that they need it.</p>

<p>I’m sure Apple would rather that everyone in the family spent the £429/$499 to get a device each but that’s not going to happen. So until they bring the price down dramatically, or they implement multi-user support, it’s never going to be the true family device that it could be.</p>
