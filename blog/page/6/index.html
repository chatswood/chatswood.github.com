  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/">Mac App Store</a> has launched and there doesn’t appear to have been any major disasters.</p>

<p>Much to my relief it has been possible to purchase a paid app (e.g. the new <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/imovie/id408981434?mt=12">iMovie 11</a>) and not only install it on my user account on another Mac, but also to use it in my wife’s user account on both Macs. This was my big concern which seems to have been unfounded. However, it’s early days yet and by all accounts not all developers have been properly checking receipts so far which means the situation could change. I’m feeling fairly confident given that I’ve tested it with Apple’s own offerings.</p>

<h2 id="available-apps">Available apps</h2>

<p>The range of apps available so far is quite small in comparison to the “free market” and the iOS App Store, but that’s only to be expected. The pleasant surprise was to see so many familiar names like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/omnifocus-for-mac/id402835630?mt=12">OmniFocus</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/marsedit/id402376225?mt=12">MarsEdit</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ibank/id402422773?mt=12">iBank</a>, as well as the expected Apple favourites like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewRoom?fcId=412904350&amp;mt=12&amp;id=29562.">iWork</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewRoom?fcId=412904253&amp;mt=12&amp;id=29562">iLife 11</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest surprise for me was the fact that <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/aperture/id408981426?mt=12">Aperture</a> is selling through the Mac App Store for just £44.99. Given that Apple are still selling the boxed version<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> for £173 through the Apple Store it’s an amazing deal. Given the prices I’ve paid since Aperture 1.5 (£220 + £79 for the 2.0 upgrade + £79 for the 3.0 upgrade!) it smarts slightly, but it’s great to see the price point reduce for an invaluable tool, and hopefully it will drive uptake and lead to renewed vigour on the applications development.</p>

<h2 id="confusion">Confusion</h2>

<p>It’s not all been plain sailing. There’s a bit of confusion out there about the fact that the Mac App Store application detects your previously licensed software as being installed. It’s not clear if this is a bug or intentional, but it is causing people to ask the question <em>“If the Mac App Store can tell that I have the software installed, can it update it for me?”</em> The answer is made pretty clear at this site: <a href="http://ifiboughtyourappalreadycaniupdateitthroughthemacappstore.com/">http://ifiboughtyourappalreadycaniupdateitthroughthemacappstore.com/</a> Basically the apps are detected as installed because they share the same bundle ID. Unfortunately they are usually different builds[^1.5] of the software which just report themselves to be the same. In short - unless you bought it through the Mac App Store, you can’t update it through the Mac App Store.</p>

<p>There’s also no way to uninstall apps through this new interface. While it’s still as easy to remove apps by dragging them to the trash, it’s not the polished solution I was hoping for. One of the obvious reasons for the Mac App Store was the fact that it reduced the hell that .dmg files could be for inexperienced users. Job done, but it still doesn’t make it any easier for the same users to remove software that they no longer want (especially as the Mac App Store makes it so much easier to download free and cheap apps to clutter our /Applications folder).</p>

<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>

<p>It’s been a good day. The store hasn’t disappointed. I’ve managed to upgrade my iLife 09 to iLife 11 for just £27 (the physical package costs £45 from Apple and contains two apps which have not been updated and which I don’t care about<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. My only gripe is that I can’t trade in my previously licensed apps (such as iBank, Delicious Library 2, MarsEdit, etc) for Mac App Store versions which are upgradeable through the Mac App Store. I’d love the upgrade convenience for sure, but I’m not going to re-buy any of them just for that! I am reserving judgement when it comes to future upgrades though…<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>I say boxed version, but it’s not even a particularly big box anymore. It comes with a DVD-ROM and a few little booklets. Not worth the price difference.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>iWeb and iDVD.<a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>My thinking here is this: upgrades on iOS are always free. I’ve not seen any details on the Mac App Store about what will happen with upgrades - I see three broad options:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>we get them for free;</li>
        <li>we have to pay full price for a new version;</li>
        <li>we have to pay an upgrade fee.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I guess time will tell. But if we get them for free it may be worth ditching old licenses for Mac App Store licenses which potentially have free updates for life. If we have to pay full price for a new version then I’ll stick with the old licensing systems.<a href="#fnref:3" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had the good fortune to listen to yet another excellent podcast from Dan Benjamin’s <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5 Studios</a> yesterday - this time the <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze">Build and Analyze</a> program Dan co-hosts with <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Arment</a> (of <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> and <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> fame).</p>

<p>The show featured a discussion on the typical work cycles of developers and fell into the mistake of re-iterating the stereotype of developers as working great in bursts of time, often late in the night. I’m not going argue much about the time frame - many developers, myself included, do work great at night time.</p>

<p>What I’m going to argue with is with the suggestion that developers write amazingly good code at this time and terrible code at other times (as suggested by Dan<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>). Unfortunately I don’t think this is necessarily true - it’s true that developers who are in the zone can churn out a lot of code when they are on a roll, but the quality of that code is not necessarily going to be high (though it could be).</p>

<p>Bugs can occur at any time, and in my opinion, when you’re on a roll there’s just as much chance of introducing bugs. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that when you’re on a roll you could be more prone to introducing bugs, because you’re thinking ahead more than you’re focused on the piece of code you’re writing right now.</p>

<p>Dan and Marco seem to agree that creativity is not something that can be done on demand, but in the end, not all software development is creative (as Marco mentioned in the podcast). Software engineering is like producing music and graphical works - there are flashes of genius which can come at unexpected times. But for the every composer who works to his own schedule, there are many more musicians who work to schedules writing jingles for adverts, music for games, music for film. For every painter, there is a graphic designer churning out a new advert, or graphics for a game, or movie special effects. For every coder who writes a sweet new algorithm for the love of it, there’s another churning out code for cash.</p>

<p>Sometimes software is art, but like any art form it can be degraded to a production line when it needs to be.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“They’re gonna be super-productive. They’re gonna write, y’know, a hundred lines of awesome code in that four hour block of time, they’re gonna fix bugs, they’re gonna get tons of stuff done. But if you try to shoehorn them into doing that work between 9 and noon, let’s say, or 9 and 1, they’re gonna write crap code. It’s gonna have tons of bugs.”</p>
</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Setting aside the geeky shame in admitting it, I’m quite excited to see the launch of the new Mac App Store this Thursday (6th January).</p>

<h2 id="excitement">Excitement</h2>

<p>I’m excited about it for a number of reasons but the main reason is how it restores the process of shopping for software to the way I remember it to be. I remember the pre-Internet days of buying software - I used to take my pocket money to the local computer store and peruse the shelves for games and other software that would take my fancy.</p>

<p>The Internet revolutionised the way companies distributed software and the way consumers bought software, but to me it didn’t completely improve upon the original process. Sure, you no longer had to trudge to the shop (in inclement weather or fair) in order to see what was available. The downside was that the huge range available and the lack of a centralised distribution point made it harder to truly browse for new software.</p>

<p>The App Store changed this for iOS, and the Mac App Store will hopefully do the same for Mac OS X. I’m looking forward to being able to browse categories for new software and especially to a centralised update mechanism for software. I’m particularly interested to see how it fares with new and less experienced Mac users.</p>

<h2 id="trepidation">Trepidation</h2>

<p>I’ll say it up front: with anything that Apple control, there’s always going to be a risk of a censored view of the world. They are already the law when it comes to iOS apps, and they will also be the same for everything sold in the Mac App Store. Thankfully, side-loading is not prohibited with OS X the way it is on iOS so developers who cannot pass Apple’s stringent controls can still offer their apps for sale through their own channels.</p>

<p>I’m also concerned about how Apple are going to handle some aspects such as multi-user systems. At present I (begrudgingly) share my Macs with my wife, and when I buy a piece of software and install it, my wife is licensed to use it also. Apple have said that software bought from a Mac App Store account will be usable on other Macs tied to the same account. What they haven’t said is whether the Mac App Store account applies to the whole Mac, or if it is tied to the Apple ID only.</p>

<p>For me this could really make or break the new Mac App Store. I’ll still scour the Internet for independently licensed software rather than pay twice for 2 users to use the software on the same Mac.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuing with the recent snow theme… being stuck in the house for a while inevitably leads me to idly browse the InterWebs in search of new things to buy<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that I don’t really need.</p>

<p>Today I’ve been looking at snow blade attachments for the front of the ride-on mower which would convert it into a small scale snow plough. We’ve got a nice <a href="http://www.castelgarden.com/">Castelgarden</a> mower and, lo-and-behold, Castelgarden produce the <a href="http://products.castelgarden.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=17203&amp;catalogId=13551&amp;productId=218135&amp;categoryId=66858&amp;topCategoryId=55904">snow blade</a> you see above.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it’s a bit late to be getting one (both time-wise and financially) but this is one purchase that could definitely be on the cards if the recent changes to our winters become more permanent. In the meantime it’s back to the trusty new <a href="http://blog.chatswood.org.uk/post/2349788295/shovel">snow shovel</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Maybe it’s just the child in me, but I can’t help but feel disappointed that the flash weather warnings issued by the <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/">Met Office</a> for a heavy and disruptive snowfall did not materialise overnight. I have nothing to gain by seeing the entire country ravaged and paralysed by Arctic conditions but I’m going to be a little selfish here.</p>

<p>We’d done the hard yards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the heating oil tank was full;</li>
  <li>the coal bunker was full;</li>
  <li>the cars were filled with fuel for emergencies;</li>
  <li>the house was full of food (especially bread and milk);</li>
  <li>the fridge was full of beer and the cupboard full of crisps;</li>
  <li>Call of Duty: Black Ops and Rock Band 3 were ready to go.</li>
</ul>

<p>We were ready for a weekend (or more) trapped in the house.</p>

<p>We’d been warned (though in my mind, I’d been <em>promised</em>) that we would be getting the kind of snow that would stop us from opening the doors to the house.</p>

<p>Last night’s output - an inch of snow.</p>

<ol>
  <li>comedy gold - the author has really made an effort to come across as idiotic as possible;</li>
  <li>idiotic - the author has got no clue about computers, which makes this comedy gold.</li>
</ol>

<p>My personal highlight:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To make the Mac [Thunderbird] program livable, I increased the font to 16 point, then continued writing emails to military sources. That night, at 3:30 a.m., I awoke up with a disturbing realization. On my high-resolution iMac my 16-point lettering may have looked like normal size, but to the officials now receiving my letters, my emails must have looked like they were scribbled in the balloon-type of an eighth grade amateur.”</p>

<p>Genius. Or idiocy. Or genius. Or idiocy. Argh - can’t decide!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The never-ending river of Mac software bundles continues to flow past me. My<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> experience to date has always been the same: these bundles inevitably contain just one piece of software that I actually want or need, and a lot of extra filler that I’ll never use.</p>

<p>But finally a bundle has come along that actually contains more than one application that I’ve been holding out for. That bundle is the <a href="https://indiemacgiftpack.com/">Indie Mac Gift Pack</a>.</p>

<p>Not only does it roll off the tongue, but for $60 I was able to pick up <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/">Mars Edit</a> and <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library 2</a> - I was on the verge of buying both for a combined total of $80 so I’m very pleased to make a bit of a saving.</p>

<p>As usual there is still some filler however I may actually get some use out of some of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Acorn 2</em> - image editing software - I might finally be able to give up the horror that is The GIMP on OS X.</li>
  <li><em>SousChef</em> - a recipe application which draws on a Internet-based repository of recipes.</li>
  <li><em>RadioShift</em> - tool for recording Internet radio streams.</li>
  <li><em>Sound Studio 4</em> - audio editor.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is an interesting commentary from <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Arment</a>. One thing that rang particularly true was this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“That’s why that PC on your banker’s desk is probably running Windows 2000, an  11-year-old platform: because it’s extraordinarily expensive to update it, and  the current system works acceptably without any massive, one-time expenditures  on this year’s budget.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why it doesn’t matter what kind of business I go into the person behind the desk/counter always seems to say <em>“I’m really sorry - the computers are running really slow today.”</em> A quick look at the screen or the box on/under the desk usually reveals the same thing - they are inevitably running an old OS on antiquated hardware.</p>

<p>To me this is why companies need to adopt something like Chrome OS - a lightweight, low-cost hardware platform using easily upgradeable software is the only way to combat the permanent “slow days” that cost everyone time without incurring the “massive, one-time expenditures” that Marco mentions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At last - mainstream IT media is finally catching on to what I’ve been saying for the past 3 years.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong - I love Linux as a server OS, and I was a huge advocate of it as a desktop OS for a long time. I used to write tutorials and reviews for <a href="http://www.linuxformat.com/">Linux Format</a> magazine so I really put my money where my mouth was at the time.</p>

<p>But about 3 years ago, I realised that despite all my advocacy I was still spending more time configuring my Linux OS than I was being productive with it. At that point in time all I wanted was a UNIX-like OS that worked out of the box - no fiddling with drivers or arcane config files. That’s why I gave Mac OS X a blast and I haven’t looked back since.</p>

<p>OS X has it’s flaws, but compared to life with Linux it has been a breeze. I’ll concede that in the last 3 years desktop Linux has come along way, but I really do think it has missed the boat and I think it boils down to the following issues: </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>There are too many varieties of Linux distributions out there</em> - it’s too hard to know what distribution to use, especially for newcomers. Distributions all have different ways of doing things, and despite efforts to rectify the situation there’s no real standard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>There are too many competing software projects</em> - in a similar way to the distributions spreading their efforts too thin, projects like KDE and GNOME compete unnecessarily. Instead of combining their efforts to make a superb desktop environment, they continue to soldier on in parallel with each other - neither making any real headway.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>There are too many hardware variations to support</em> - the biggest problem Microsoft faces for Windows is maintaining compatibility with all the hardware variations out there. Windows gets a bad rap at times but considering how many machines it runs on it’s pretty remarkable really. Linux faces the same problem, but with one major disadvantage - Microsoft got a huge head start.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>On the server side, however, Linux is in my opinion the best OS out there. Maybe that’s what the Linux community should be focussing their efforts onto. Maybe if they rationalised the distros and created themselves a reference hardware platform they could totally own the server space. Then and only then should they start thinking about the desktop again.</p>
