  <div class="entry-content"><p>I made the decision recently that I was going to stop buying physical media and make digital purchases <em>where possible</em>. By <em>where possible</em> I mean that I will buy the digital media under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when I can not buy a physical CD for a reasonable price;</li>
  <li>when I can get the digital media in a lossless format<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The new album from Vince Clarke and Martin Gore (collectively known as <a href="http://www.facebook.com/VCMGofficial">VCMG</a>) was released today. I figured this was a good opportunity to try the new purchasing strategy and I decided to hop over to the <a href="http://mute.com/artists/vcmg">artist’s page</a> on mute.com to see about where to grab some digital goodness.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> <br />
The obvious place to look is the mute.com store. A quick search for VCMG reveals that they have a <em>“Digital Album”</em> for sale. And only £6.99. I click the link, and see that the format is 320kbps MP3s. That’s not what I’m looking for. Back to the artist page to try again.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong><br />
While on the artist page, I notice a mention of VCMG’s previous EP being available on <a href="http://www.beatport.com/">Beatport</a>. Beatport is a site I’ve used before and has a good range of electronic and dance music. I head over there and search for VCMG. Result. It says £7.65 for the whole album so I add it to my basket. Hmmm, now there’s VAT added. £8.80. Not so good. And it’s only MP3. There is an option to upgrade to WAV but at a cost of £1 per track! THis brings the total cost to £20.30. I’ll try elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong><br />
I head to Google and search for <em>vcmg ssss wav</em> and find the second result is Juno Download. They’re upfront about pricing and show the options: 192kbps MP3, 320kbps MP3 and WAV. Their prices are fairly competitive for MP3s, but they still attract a £5.00 premium for WAV bringing the total price to £10.99. At nearly half the price of Beatport it is certainly an improvement, but it’s not what I’d hoped for.</p>

<p>I do some more googling around using search terms such as <em>“vcmg ssss wav”</em>, <em>“vcmg ssss lossless”</em>, <em>“vcmg ssss flac”</em>. Much of what comes back is in the form of illegal torrents, so I decide to throw in the search modifier <em>“-torrent”</em>. Still I get mostly illegal download sources.</p>

<p>This dancing around the web has become boring now so I go old-school on the problem. I hit up Amazon and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006XABLAE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chatswood-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B006XABLAE">bought the physical CD from there</a>. For £8.99 I get the physical media and the ability to make FLAC and MP3 files from it. It’s annoying, but it’s still the best value out there.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>For now my preferred formats are WAV or FLAC. WAV files will be converted to FLAC for long term storage and the WAV files subsequently discarded.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.reederapp.com/mac/">Reeder for Mac</a> is one of my favourite and most used pieces of software. It came out around the time that Apple started emphasising the use of gestures for OS X and Reeder for Mac was not shy about incorporating these amazing features, and even making them customisable. I particularly like the ability to swipe<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> left to open the article in  the in-app browser view and use it regularly.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.reederapp.com/mac/_screens/img/3.png" alt="Reeder Screenshot" title="Reeder for Mac" /></p>

<p>Swiping gestures have a feeling of “pushing” layers about. The “reverse” scrolling on OS X Lion (which of course came from iOS) is most easily explained to a newcomer to the concept by explaining in terms of a large sheet of paper on a desk. If you want to see what is towards the bottom of the paper, you push (or wipe) the sheet upwards. If you want to see what is on the right hand side of the paper you push it to the left.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, if you have multiple pieces of paper on top of one another, you can swipe the top piece aside in order to expose the next piece down. You can then swipe the original top sheet in the opposite direction to put it back where you got it.</p>

<p>I instinctively model the article view in <a href="http://www.reederapp.com/mac/">Reeder for Mac</a> as a sheet on top of the browser view. When I swipe left to expose the browser view my mind assumes that I have pushed the article view aside to get to the browser view<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. As a result, my mind instinctively wants to swipe right to return to the article view.</p>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2012/03/reeder_preferences.png" alt="Reeder Preferences" title="Reeder Preferences" /></p>

<p>The preferences support this by allowing you to use <em>Swipe left</em> and <em>Swipe right</em> for the same behaviour - “Toggle in-app browser”. This is a waste of a gesture - why not allow <em>Swipe left</em> for the in-app browser, and <em>Swipe right</em> for, say, toggling the Readability mode. Then the <em>opposite</em> gestures can be used to return to the article view, not using the same gesture again.</p>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2012/03/gesture_targets.png" alt="Gesture targets" title="Gesture targets" /></p>

<p>Selecting <em>Swipe left</em> presents a substantial like of actions that can be assigned to the gesture. For fans of customisation this is great, but offering this level of configurability means that an intuitive use of gestures cannot be offered. To do so would require a set of gesture preferences for every view in the application, which would be unworkable.</p>

<p>Gestures are in danger of becoming shortcuts to key commands and toolbar buttons. This is a waste of the fantastic ability that gestures offer - manipulation. Manipulating objects with pinch-to-zoom or rotations, navigation with swipes. These are the natural uses for gestures.</p>

<p>Toggling settings are where buttons are happiest.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>I swipe left - I may have tweaked the stock config some time ago and therefore your action may be different.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>This is emphasised by the fact that an animation moves part of the UI to the left.<a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2011/12/iTunesMatch.png" alt="Match logo" title="Waiting..." /></p>

<p>After a false start, iTunes Match became available in the UK, sooner than I expected. Judging by the image above, it could be a while before my collection is all sorted. I’m just glad I don’t have my singles collection in there yet.</p>

<h3 id="one-more-thing">One more thing…</h3>

<p>I’d just like to see one teeny, tiny little addition to the service in future, which would really help my “ripping workflow”. Currently when I buy a CD (yes, I still buy them) I take it out of the box, and stick it straight into the Mac to get ripped. I then tag the MP3s, back them up etc. It would be really nice if I could just stick in the CD and have iTunes detect it, <em>Match</em> the tracks, and let me download the tracks without ripping.</p>

<p>I suspect some would say that this would be open to abuse - a user could borrow a stack of CDs from their friend, and stick them in one by one to build up their own “legitimate” collection. In the end though, it only saves the time-consuming rip. Those people will probably just grab the audio files from their friend anyway.</p>

<p>So, come on Apple: just one more step to make life a little bit simpler.</p>

  <p>Two men are being questioned by coppers after the “smash and grab” raid at 1am today, just days after the death of billionaire Apple baron Steve Jobs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some reason <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">The Register</a> decided that a story about a smash and grab at a consumer electronics store needed a reminder about Steve Jobs passing away. But they couldn’t just leave it at a simple reference - they had to point out that he was <em>“billionaire Apple Baron”</em>. I’m not sure of the relevance.</p>

<p>Unless of course the thieves took these facts into account…</p>

<p><em>Thief 1: Dude we’re hitting the Apple Store tonight.</em></p>

<p><em>Thief 2: Excellent! But wait. Steve Jobs only just died - wouldn’t it be a little bit insensitive?</em></p>

<p><em>Thief 1: Nah! Sure he was a billionaire Apple baron - it’s okay to rob from them.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After recently switching to a pre-paid mobile service I’ve been a bit more aware of how much things cost. We recently took a trip to Dublin which involves roaming and being cost-conscious I ensured my iPhone had <em>Data Roaming</em> disabled. Unfortunately we got a bit lost for a while and I had to turn on the tap for a while to use Google Maps.</p>

<p>I was sure I hadn’t used much data, but when I got home I checked my usage and found that I’d spent over £8 checking Google Maps for a couple of minutes. Admittedly Orange had warned me it would cost £4/MB but I couldn’t see how I’d used that much. Then I realised that there were probably some background tasks using the network connection which I didn’t have much control over.</p>

<h2 id="location-location-location">Location Location Location</h2>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2011/08/location.png" alt="location.png" /></p>

<p>The <em>Location Services</em> section of the iOS <em>Settings</em> app is a prime example of how to get that kind of control. Instead of having a single on-off control I’d love to see the ability to enable roaming services for specific apps and services.</p>

<p>Yes, I know. I could just disable background checking of email and disable push notifications. However that means I’ve got to go back and re-enable all those services again once I’m back home. I want that control in a menu that only applies to roaming allowing me to leave those settings for the next time I head over the border.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Matt Asay wrote a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/16/asay_on_goole_patents_and_apple/">generally interesting article</a> on the Motorola Mobility acquisition by Google but this stood out as a strange and flawed argument: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second, it’s critical to remember who buys Android devices versus iOS 
devices: kids buy Android (“It’s cheap!”) while adults largely buy iOS 
(“Pricey, but it makes me cool with the other soccer dads!”). Guess 
which group will be buying devices long into the future?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry Matt, but you’ve made a big assumption here that “kids” will continue buying the cheap devices even when they can afford to buy the pricey ones. Many people I know who own Android devices fall into one of two categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They can’t afford an iOS device right now but would consider jumping ship to iOS if they could afford it.</li>
  <li>They dislike Apple and persist in using an unsatisfactory device as though making a stand.</li>
</ol>

<p>Otherwise, a decent article highlighting the idiocy of the mobile patent arms race, spoiled by a small dose of fanboi-baiting. Dammit. It obviously worked.</p>
