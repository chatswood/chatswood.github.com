<blockquote>
  <p>Two men are being questioned by coppers after the “smash and grab” raid at 1am today, just days after the death of billionaire Apple baron Steve Jobs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some reason <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">The Register</a> decided that a story about a smash and grab at a consumer electronics store needed a reminder about Steve Jobs passing away. But they couldn’t just leave it at a simple reference - they had to point out that he was <em>“billionaire Apple Baron”</em>. I’m not sure of the relevance.</p>

<p>Unless of course the thieves took these facts into account…</p>

<p><em>Thief 1: Dude we’re hitting the Apple Store tonight.</em></p>

<p><em>Thief 2: Excellent! But wait. Steve Jobs only just died - wouldn’t it be a little bit insensitive?</em></p>

<p><em>Thief 1: Nah! Sure he was a billionaire Apple baron - it’s okay to rob from them.</em></p>

<p>I love the fact that they say it limits consumer choice, completely ignoring the fact that by making a device so similar to the iPad that they reduced the buyers decision to purchasing an iPad or an inferior iPad clone.</p>

<p>Now that is severely limiting consumer choice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After recently switching to a pre-paid mobile service I’ve been a bit more aware of how much things cost. We recently took a trip to Dublin which involves roaming and being cost-conscious I ensured my iPhone had <em>Data Roaming</em> disabled. Unfortunately we got a bit lost for a while and I had to turn on the tap for a while to use Google Maps.</p>

<p>I was sure I hadn’t used much data, but when I got home I checked my usage and found that I’d spent over £8 checking Google Maps for a couple of minutes. Admittedly Orange had warned me it would cost £4/MB but I couldn’t see how I’d used that much. Then I realised that there were probably some background tasks using the network connection which I didn’t have much control over.</p>

<h2 id="location-location-location">Location Location Location</h2>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2011/08/location.png" alt="location.png" /></p>

<p>The <em>Location Services</em> section of the iOS <em>Settings</em> app is a prime example of how to get that kind of control. Instead of having a single on-off control I’d love to see the ability to enable roaming services for specific apps and services.</p>

<p>Yes, I know. I could just disable background checking of email and disable push notifications. However that means I’ve got to go back and re-enable all those services again once I’m back home. I want that control in a menu that only applies to roaming allowing me to leave those settings for the next time I head over the border.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Matt Asay wrote a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/16/asay_on_goole_patents_and_apple/">generally interesting article</a> on the Motorola Mobility acquisition by Google but this stood out as a strange and flawed argument: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second, it’s critical to remember who buys Android devices versus iOS 
devices: kids buy Android (“It’s cheap!”) while adults largely buy iOS 
(“Pricey, but it makes me cool with the other soccer dads!”). Guess 
which group will be buying devices long into the future?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry Matt, but you’ve made a big assumption here that “kids” will continue buying the cheap devices even when they can afford to buy the pricey ones. Many people I know who own Android devices fall into one of two categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They can’t afford an iOS device right now but would consider jumping ship to iOS if they could afford it.</li>
  <li>They dislike Apple and persist in using an unsatisfactory device as though making a stand.</li>
</ol>

<p>Otherwise, a decent article highlighting the idiocy of the mobile patent arms race, spoiled by a small dose of fanboi-baiting. Dammit. It obviously worked.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&lt;div style=”text-align:center” markdown=1&gt;
![iCloud] (http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2011/06/icloud.png)
&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<p>This week Apple announced their new iCloud service, and one facet that particularly intrigued me was the availability of <em>iTunes in the Cloud</em>. I’ll let Apple describe the concept:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>With iCloud, the music you purchase in iTunes appears 
automatically on all your devices. You can also download your 
past iTunes purchases. Where you want, when you want.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seemed like it would save a lot of headaches for me. I currently keep a stash of over 100GB of MP3s; over 9000 individual tracks; over 28 hours of listening. Ripping it all was a labour of love. The files are stored on a NAS drive and I keep a copy of every song on each of my 3 Macs<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I also have a number of iOS devices to get the music onto.</p>

<p>So this is what I do every time I buy a new CD:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rip, encode and tag the CD on my Mac Pro;</li>
  <li>Copy the files to the NAS;</li>
  <li>Import the files into iTunes on my Mac Pro;</li>
  <li>Copy the files from the NAS to my Mac Mini;</li>
  <li>Import the files into iTunes on my Mac Mini;</li>
  <li>Copy the files from the NAS to my MacBook Pro;</li>
  <li>Import the files into iTunes on my MacBook Pro;</li>
  <li>Sync the files from iTunes onto my iPhone;</li>
  <li>Sync the files from iTunes onto my iPad;</li>
  <li>Relax.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we are to believe Apple’s marketing material, this should soon be simplified to the following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rip, encode and tag the CD on my Mac Pro;</li>
  <li>Copy the files to the NAS (simply as a backup);</li>
  <li>Import the files into iTunes on my Mac Pro;</li>
  <li>Allow iTunes to send info on the new files up to iCloud;</li>
  <li>Relax (while the new tracks are synced automatically to my Mac Mini, MacBook Pro, iPhone and iPad).</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, with this level of convenience I’d almost be tempted to just buy the tracks through iTunes in the first place and forget about the hassle of ordering, ripping and storing those old-fashioned CDs.</p>

<h2 id="not-so-fast">Not so fast…</h2>

<p>If you go to <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/icloud/features/">Apple’s UK iCloud page</a> there is an asterisk in the service description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>With iCloud, the music you purchase in iTunes appears 
automatically on all your devices. You can also download your 
past iTunes purchases.* Where you want, when you want.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This asterisk informs us that the service is <em>“Starting in the US”</em>.</p>

<p>This is disappointing in itself but <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/8565587/Apples-iTunes-in-iCloud-wont-launch-in-the-UK-this-year.html">emerging reports</a> from the UK press now suggest a delay until 2012: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A spokesman for the Performing Right Society (PRS), which ensures that composers, 
songwriters and music publishers are paid for their work, told The Telegraph, that 
negotiations with Apple about ensuring rights in the UK had started but were at a 
“very early stage”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How long do these publishing companies think it is acceptable to treat their customers with such contempt? Why do they get away with treating some territories as second-class citizens?</p>

<p>I pay for my CDs the same way that someone from the US pays for their CDs. Why does the US citizen get access to that music through Apple’s iCloud service and I don’t?</p>

<p>The answer I expect is probably going to come down to some excuse about the fact that I don’t own the music I bought, I simply licensed it. I’m just not quite sure when I agreed to that license. It doesn’t say anything on the CD case. I bought the CD under the same conditions that someone in the US bought their CD under. How come their license is different?</p>

<p>For now I guess I just have to look on enviously while my US counterparts enjoy the iCloud. Hopefully the outlook will be cloudy for us in the rest of the world in the near future.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Yes, I could probably stream songs to the machines from the NAS, but I like having an offline copy of the music on the machines.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I took the plunge and tried updating my iPhone 4 to iOS 5. I marvelled at the shiny new process which allows untethered activation.</p>

<p>I then got frustrated when presented with the following message:</p>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2011-06-07/phone_error.jpg" alt="iPhone error" /></p>

<p>But wait! It says on the screen that I can connect the iPhone to iTunes to activate it the old-fashioned way. Salvation!</p>

<p>And then:</p>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2011-06-07/itunes_error.png" alt="iTunes error" /></p>

<p>Great.</p>

<p>Thankfully I got it resolved by borrowing an unlocked SIM card - once inserted into the iPhone the activation server started working again. I can’t tell if it was the unlocked SIM or a coincidental re-appearance of the activation server which did the trick.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="aka-how-to-lose-1000-pounds-overnight">(aka How to lose 1000 pounds overnight)</h2>

<p>I recently decided to splurge on one of the new 2011 MacBook Pros, and am very glad I did. My 2007 MBP has served me well and I’ve been very pleased with it’s performance over the years, but there were a few reasons why I thought I could justify ditching the older model:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it was out of warranty;</li>
  <li>the fans were coming on more frequently with daily work;</li>
  <li>the battery was only lasting a paltry 2-3 hours (after 2 replacements);</li>
  <li>it was feeling a bit heavy for carrying to work every day;</li>
  <li>the 15” screen was feeling like overkill;</li>
  <li>it was taking too much room in my bag.</li>
</ul>

<p>It might seem a bit flamboyant, but I was spending about 12 hours a day on my MBP. I was carrying it to and from work 4-5 days a week. I was carting it about the house in the evening, having to find the charger, trying to keep it cool.</p>

<p>It was just becoming a lot less fun.</p>

<p>So I did <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/03/13-i7-macbook-pro-review.ars">my research</a>, got the finances in order and then went ahead and purchased the new 13” Core-i5 2011 MBP.</p>

<p>I’m now under warranty again and have a machine that can cope with my workload, and yet is not too heavy a load for me to use or carry about. I was concerned about losing the screen resolution, but it hasn’t been too bad so far (especially as I’m working attached to a monitor during the working day).</p>
