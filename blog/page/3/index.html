<p>For me this sums up everything that there is to being a dad. When the subject of bicycle helmets came up in the past, I always swore that I’d never wear one. I trotted out the old fallback position of “I never needed one when I was a kid, I don’t need one now, and my kids will never need one either.”</p>

<p>Now that I’m actually a dad, my position has changed. From here on I’ll do whatever is necessary to set a good example for my daughter. How times changes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While listening to the recent <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/">Mac Power Users</a> podcast on <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/2012/04/mpu-79-hazel-3-0/">using Hazel</a> I got the impression that host <a href="http://www.katiefloyd.me/">Katie Floyd</a> wasn’t a fan of using the Mac Desktop as a storage location for files.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I’ve heard this opinion before - often accompanied with disparaging remarks suggesting that it is an uncouth and savage practice, befitting more of Windows users than of elegant and refined Mac users. This just isn’t the case - for a start Windows users are people too, and just think about it: if we weren’t supposed to use the Desktop, why would Apple have made it just a regular folder?</p>

<p>I can be a bit of a cleanliness freak when it comes to my hard disks<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> but surprisingly I’m actually a fan of throwing documents on the Desktop as a working storage area. If I’m working on a document, downloading some material or even just trying something out I tend to leave things on the Desktop while I’m working on them.</p>

<p>I see this as being akin to the real world - when I’m working with paper documents I tend to spread them around me in order to have the material within easy reach. I want to be able to do the same with the Mac Desktop so that I don’t have to root around in folders for the relevant files.</p>

<h2 id="too-much-hassle">Too Much Hassle?</h2>

<p>I guess some people might find it tough working with the Mac Desktop. Sometimes it can be hard to arrange windows so that you can quickly open documents or move them about, especially when it comes to Macs with smaller displays like MacBook Pros and Airs.</p>

<p>My advice to people is to take advantage of Exposé - especially on newer Macs with gesture support. I use the “Spread with thumb and three fingers” gesture to access the Desktop and have immediate access to my files for double-clicking or drag-and-drop operations.</p>

<p>Admittedly dragging and dropping can be troublesome at times. To drop into an open application you generally need to drag the item over the dock icon for the application, wait for it to show the open windows for the application and then hold the item over the desired window until it comes to the foreground. This can be cumbersome, so it’s worth grabbing <a href="http://www.eternalstorms.at/yoink/">Yoink</a> from the Mac App Store. Once installed it provides a handy tray you can drag onto quickly, then Cmd-Tab (or otherwise navigate) to your desired application and drag from the Yoink tray into the application.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-it-under-control">Keeping It Under Control</h2>

<p>Of course, there’s always a danger that your Desktop can get out of control if you start using it for multiple active projects. The best way to combat this is with a bit of discipline, but if you need a hand you can always turn to Hazel for some help.</p>

<p>At present I use a two-level indicator as to the relevance of a file on the desktop. After two days of inactivity Hazel marks a file with an Orange label so that I can see that it hasn’t been used recently. After a further two days of inactivity Hazel marks the file with a Red label as a final warning.</p>

<p>Ideally though my desktop would be reasonably clear at the end of every day so that I can start from scratch every morning. Again Hazel could come to the rescue, by automatically clearing items from the desktop at the end of the working day. The rule shown below is the start of a system for implementing this:</p>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2012/04/blue_rule.png" alt="Blue Rule" /></p>

<p>The idea here is that I can have multiple projects organised according to label colour. At the end of the working day Hazel will sweep all files on the Desktop with a Blue label into the Blue folder. The next time I go to work on the project I can just drag the items back onto the Desktop to start again. It’s a bit like keeping your real life working papers in boxes - at the end of the day you just sweep the papers off the desktop and into the box. Next day, dump the contents of the box onto the nice clean desktop.</p>

<p>See - working on the Desktop is not just for savages.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>John Gruber added an <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/04/09/itunes-match">update to this post</a> in which he explained that he had mixed the terms <em>iTunes Match</em> and <em>iTunes in the Cloud</em>. I think the easiest way to differentiate is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a></strong>: this is Apple’s overall cloud strategy that encompasses the ability to store application data and a media locker in the cloud;</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/features/">iTunes in the Cloud</a></strong>: this is the iCloud component that allows you to re-download material from your media locker. This includes books, apps, music, TV shows and (depending on where you are) movies;</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-match/">iTunes Match</a></strong>: this is the subscription service by which Apple allow you to music files not originally purchased from iTunes to your media locker.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe it’s not 100% accurate, but it’s enough to keep it straight in my mind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a recent article about the Flashback Trojan that’s been infecting many Macs Arik Hesseldahl at AllThingsD led off with the title <em><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120406/whats-this-a-mac-virus-no-actually-its-a-weakness-in-java/">What’s This? A Mac Virus? No, Actually It’s a Weakness in Java</a></em>. Intentional or not, this title contains the suggestion that it’s not Apple’s fault, it’s Oracle’s (with a hint of “Macs are still invulnerable” thrown in for good measure).</p>

<p>He’s right of course - it’s not a Mac virus. (If we want to be pedantic it’s not even a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus">virus</a>, it’s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)">trojan</a>.) But Arik goes on to try to diminish the importance of this trojan, and worse, he seems to try to admonish Apple of their responsibility:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does that let Apple off the hook entirely? No, though to its credit, Apple had a fix ready within a week of learning of this vulnerability. That’s not exactly a pokey response, especially when the problem lies not directly within Apple’s software, but in Oracle’s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The exploit in Java that is used by the Flashback Trojan has existed for some time. It was reported in September 2011 in <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3544">CVE-2011-3544</a> and Oracle themselves <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpuoct2011-443431.html">put out patched Java runtimes</a> in October 2011.</p>

<p>Contrary to the quote above, rather than getting a patch out within a week, Apple have actually sat on this one for a long time. Disappointingly they only released their updates after the <a href="http://news.drweb.com/show/?i=2341">initial announcement</a> by Dr. Web caused the story to blow up.</p>

<p>So, Arik, let’s not give Apple any credit on this one. The current estimate is 600,000 Macs infected with this malware. Yes, it’s an Java vulnerability, but it is Apple who distributes the Java runtime for OS X, not Oracle. They had the opportunity to fix this in a timely fashion, and chose not to, putting many of their customers systems at risk by not doing so.</p>

<p>Rather than deserving credit, I rather think they owe their customers instead.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> is an amazing place. There are so many diverse projects hosted there, and it’s fantastic to be able to quickly create a repo and share code with the world. I’ve been a member for just under a year, and in that time I’ve gone from just downloading other people’s projects, to forking and contributing to Open Source projects, to creating my own public and private repositories.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with GitHub and it’s pricing plans, you’ll know that you can create unlimited public projects with an unlimited number of contributors for free. This is probably one of the reasons why GitHub has become a de facto standard for public projects<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>About eight months ago I started working on some personal projects, which I just wasn’t prepared to share with the world. I did some due diligence had a look at the various options available to me (including <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> and <a href="http://beanstalkapp.com/">Beanstalk</a>), and made the decision to pay for the GitHub Micro account (at $7 per month). I don’t regret that decision, as I think GitHub was definitely the best option at the time.</p>

<p>Things are different now though. In October last year <a href="http://blog.bitbucket.org/2011/10/03/bitbucket-now-rocks-git/">BitBucket announced</a> that they were now going to offer support for Git repositories (prior to that they’d only had a <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> offering). This was a pretty big deal for many potential users and they offer a very attractive pricing scheme to sweeten the deal.</p>

<p>With GitHub I was getting 5 private repos and 1 collaborator for $7 per month. With <a href="https://bitbucket.org/plans">BitBucket</a> I can get unlimited private repos with 5 collaborators for free. I also get tighter integration with Atlassian’s <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview">JIRA</a>, which I use for issue tracking over the GitHub system. At first glance this seems like a no-brainer, except…</p>

<h2 id="community">Community</h2>

<p>There’s only one real problem with BitBucket. It’s not GitHub. Don’t get me wrong, <a href="http://www.pocoo.org/~blackbird/github-vs-bitbucket/bitbucket.html">it tries very hard to be GitHub</a>, but there’s one area where GitHub beats the competition hands down - community.</p>

<p>GitHub is home to so many public projects that it’s the natural place to fork a project or create a new one. There is no way that I know of to fork/pull request between GitHub and BitBucket. It’s also hard to justify moving public repos from GitHub when people who may find them use might not want to fork on a “smaller” site like BitBucket.</p>

<p>As of today, I’ve imported my private repos into BitBucket, and have downgraded my GitHub account. Anything I want to keep private will now go to BitBucket, and I’m going public only on GitHub. If I want to fork a project I’ll do it on GitHub, or if I want to share a repo making it as easy as possible for other people to use, I’ll do that on GitHub as well.</p>

<p>I was concerned that some of my private projects wouldn’t move to BitBucket cleanly - I have a couple of Xcode projects that utilise Open Source frameworks to provide core functionality. I’ve already forked these on GitHub and I didn’t want to lose that flexibility. Thankfully Git submodules allows me to get the best of both worlds. Even though my parent repos now originate on BitBucket, I was still able to define submodules which are originated on GitHub with no ill effects.</p>

<p>Now, GitHub, please don’t announce any pricing plan changes for the next few months so that I can at least get settled in over at BitBucket.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
  <p>…of all the people I have talked to in the past two years about the iPad no one ever asked me about a smaller version.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Federico Viticci <a href="http://ticci.org/seven">briefly responds</a> to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/05/seven-inch-ipad/">MG Siegler’s article <em>Seven</em></a>.</p>

<p>I was surprised when Siegler wrote that people were saying they wished there was a smaller version of the iPad. I hang around with a lot of nerds, and even they haven’t really been “wishing” for a smaller iPad until the <a href="http://www.appadvice.com/appnn/2012/03/apple-has-163-reasons-to-release-fabled-ipad-mini">rumour mill started cranking recently</a>.</p>

<p>Viticci’s previous post on the subject sums it up for me when it comes to a 7.85” model - <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/when-it-comes-to-7-85-ipad-the-question-is-why/">“Why?”</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subscriber_line">DSL</a> is the most popular broadband Internet access method in the UK as it is one of the few methods available across the majority of the country. Cable services are largely restricted to the cities, and high speed wireless is often a disappointment in reality. </p>

<p>While symmetric DSL is available in some areas, the sensible decision was taken during the late nineties/early “noughties” to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_digital_subscriber_line">asymmetric DSL</a> as the default (and often only) option. ADSL results in a small portion of the available bandwidth being used for upload capacity, and the remaining bandwidth being used for download capacity. There are technical reasons supporting the asymmetry, and also practical reasons that were beneficial for the user experience.</p>

<p>At the time it was fair to say that users downloaded a lot more data than they uploaded. Few people ran home servers, the usage of cloud services was limited, and the ISPs wanted to discourage peer-to-peer file sharing - what better way than by limiting upload speeds.</p>

<p>Times change and nowadays home broadband users want to be able to run personal home servers (e.g. for accessing media from outside the home), they want to host online games, they want to use cloud storage for their personal files.</p>

<p>ISPs have acknowledged this to some extent, and most “super-fast” broadband services come with a generous upload bandwidth. This is great, but as usual brings no benefit to those of us out of range of these services.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s time for ISPs to start getting a bit more symmetrical with their offerings for the second-class citizens. I rarely need the full 5.5Mbps download speed I can achieve with my broadband service, but am constantly maxing out the 440kbps upload speed I am limited to. I’m not asking to run a popular web-site from home, but I do want to be able to reliably “live in the cloud”. Like the first-class citizens who were blessed with the “super-fast” broadband.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I made the decision recently that I was going to stop buying physical media and make digital purchases <em>where possible</em>. By <em>where possible</em> I mean that I will buy the digital media under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when I can not buy a physical CD for a reasonable price;</li>
  <li>when I can get the digital media in a lossless format<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The new album from Vince Clarke and Martin Gore (collectively known as <a href="http://www.facebook.com/VCMGofficial">VCMG</a>) was released today. I figured this was a good opportunity to try the new purchasing strategy and I decided to hop over to the <a href="http://mute.com/artists/vcmg">artist’s page</a> on mute.com to see about where to grab some digital goodness.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> <br />
The obvious place to look is the mute.com store. A quick search for VCMG reveals that they have a <em>“Digital Album”</em> for sale. And only £6.99. I click the link, and see that the format is 320kbps MP3s. That’s not what I’m looking for. Back to the artist page to try again.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong><br />
While on the artist page, I notice a mention of VCMG’s previous EP being available on <a href="http://www.beatport.com/">Beatport</a>. Beatport is a site I’ve used before and has a good range of electronic and dance music. I head over there and search for VCMG. Result. It says £7.65 for the whole album so I add it to my basket. Hmmm, now there’s VAT added. £8.80. Not so good. And it’s only MP3. There is an option to upgrade to WAV but at a cost of £1 per track! THis brings the total cost to £20.30. I’ll try elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong><br />
I head to Google and search for <em>vcmg ssss wav</em> and find the second result is Juno Download. They’re upfront about pricing and show the options: 192kbps MP3, 320kbps MP3 and WAV. Their prices are fairly competitive for MP3s, but they still attract a £5.00 premium for WAV bringing the total price to £10.99. At nearly half the price of Beatport it is certainly an improvement, but it’s not what I’d hoped for.</p>

<p>I do some more googling around using search terms such as <em>“vcmg ssss wav”</em>, <em>“vcmg ssss lossless”</em>, <em>“vcmg ssss flac”</em>. Much of what comes back is in the form of illegal torrents, so I decide to throw in the search modifier <em>“-torrent”</em>. Still I get mostly illegal download sources.</p>

<p>This dancing around the web has become boring now so I go old-school on the problem. I hit up Amazon and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006XABLAE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chatswood-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B006XABLAE">bought the physical CD from there</a>. For £8.99 I get the physical media and the ability to make FLAC and MP3 files from it. It’s annoying, but it’s still the best value out there.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>For now my preferred formats are WAV or FLAC. WAV files will be converted to FLAC for long term storage and the WAV files subsequently discarded.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.reederapp.com/mac/">Reeder for Mac</a> is one of my favourite and most used pieces of software. It came out around the time that Apple started emphasising the use of gestures for OS X and Reeder for Mac was not shy about incorporating these amazing features, and even making them customisable. I particularly like the ability to swipe<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> left to open the article in  the in-app browser view and use it regularly.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.reederapp.com/mac/_screens/img/3.png" alt="Reeder Screenshot" title="Reeder for Mac" /></p>

<p>Swiping gestures have a feeling of “pushing” layers about. The “reverse” scrolling on OS X Lion (which of course came from iOS) is most easily explained to a newcomer to the concept by explaining in terms of a large sheet of paper on a desk. If you want to see what is towards the bottom of the paper, you push (or wipe) the sheet upwards. If you want to see what is on the right hand side of the paper you push it to the left.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, if you have multiple pieces of paper on top of one another, you can swipe the top piece aside in order to expose the next piece down. You can then swipe the original top sheet in the opposite direction to put it back where you got it.</p>

<p>I instinctively model the article view in <a href="http://www.reederapp.com/mac/">Reeder for Mac</a> as a sheet on top of the browser view. When I swipe left to expose the browser view my mind assumes that I have pushed the article view aside to get to the browser view<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. As a result, my mind instinctively wants to swipe right to return to the article view.</p>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2012/03/reeder_preferences.png" alt="Reeder Preferences" title="Reeder Preferences" /></p>

<p>The preferences support this by allowing you to use <em>Swipe left</em> and <em>Swipe right</em> for the same behaviour - “Toggle in-app browser”. This is a waste of a gesture - why not allow <em>Swipe left</em> for the in-app browser, and <em>Swipe right</em> for, say, toggling the Readability mode. Then the <em>opposite</em> gestures can be used to return to the article view, not using the same gesture again.</p>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2012/03/gesture_targets.png" alt="Gesture targets" title="Gesture targets" /></p>

<p>Selecting <em>Swipe left</em> presents a substantial like of actions that can be assigned to the gesture. For fans of customisation this is great, but offering this level of configurability means that an intuitive use of gestures cannot be offered. To do so would require a set of gesture preferences for every view in the application, which would be unworkable.</p>

<p>Gestures are in danger of becoming shortcuts to key commands and toolbar buttons. This is a waste of the fantastic ability that gestures offer - manipulation. Manipulating objects with pinch-to-zoom or rotations, navigation with swipes. These are the natural uses for gestures.</p>

<p>Toggling settings are where buttons are happiest.</p>

      <p>I swipe left - I may have tweaked the stock config some time ago and therefore your action may be different.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>This is emphasised by the fact that an animation moves part of the UI to the left.<a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
