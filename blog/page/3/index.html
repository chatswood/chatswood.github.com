  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m not sure who these <em><a href="http://wispa.it/">wispa</a></em> folks are, but <a href="http://wispa.it/upto-charge-upto-service/">they raise a similar point</a> to one that I’ve been making lately to whoever will listen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If your supermarket charged you full price for ‘upto’ a Kg of sugar, or the service station charged you full price for ‘upto’ a gallon of petrol they would be prosecuted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(via <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/04/16/wispa_upto_campaign/">The Register</a>)</p>

<p>We pay for an “up to 16Mbps” service. Unfortunately my ISP - <a href="http://www.productsandservices.bt.com/consumerProducts/displayCategory.do?categoryId=CON-TOTAL-BB-R1">BT Total Broadband</a> - and the underlying wholesale provider <a href="http://www.openreach.co.uk/orpg/home/home.do">Openreach</a> have not seen fit to install ADSL2 hardware in our local exchange. This mere technicality means that my “up to 16Mbps” service is instantly constrained by the 8Mbps limit on ADSL Max technology.</p>

<p>We pay £26 a month for a service that, through no fault of our own, can only deliver 50% of the promised<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> service. That’s bad enough, but we’re still talking theoretical limits here. Our actual delivered service is just over 6Mbps with a fair wind. So what we actually get is not 16Mbps, but just 37.5% of that. Other BT Total Broadband customers on the same package will pay the same amount, yet they may get 100% of the promised service.</p>

<p>We actually fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. A good friend is also a customer with BT Total Broadband, and therefore is also signed up to a service that is advertised as being up to 16Mbps. His actual delivered service is 0.5Mbps. To save you doing the mental arithmetic, that is just 3.125% of the maximum theoretical service. Yet he pays 100% of the price.</p>

<p>Back in 2009 the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8012848.stm">UK government said in their budget</a> that they would commit to ensuring that everyone in the country would have access to 2Mbps broadband by 2012 though they’ve now said that will be 2015. We still have people unable to achieve that target. Worse still, these people are being forced to pay prices similar to those paid by users of next-generation broadband services. </p>

<h2 id="not-going-far-enough">Not going far enough</h2>

<p>I not only agree with what <a href="http://wispa.it/">wispa</a> are saying in their campaign, but I feel that they are not going far enough. Not only should people be paying a price proportionate to the service they receive, but those receiving a service below the governments “target” of 2Mbps should not be paying a single penny. And yet the campaign from <a href="http://wispa.it/">wispa</a> only covers the concept of people not getting the full “up to” service.</p>

<p>There is an even wider problem that is becoming more prevalent as next-generation broadband services are being rolled out. Amongst my friends, family and colleagues there is a huge disparity amongst the level of broadband services available. Some people have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_to_the_x">Fibre To The Cabinet</a>, some have ADSL2, some have just regular ADSL, some have 3G wireless, and some have nothing.</p>

<p>The strange thing is that many of these differing levels of service cost around the same price. As an example, at home we only receive regular ADSL - this will cost about £18 a month for up to 16Mbps and 40GB allowance<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. According to <a href="http://www.productsandservices.bt.com/consumerProducts/displayTopic.do?topicId=29017">BT’s Infinity product pages</a> the base level package is also £18, but this includes up to 38Mbps and the same 40GB allowance.</p>

<p>We pay the same price for an inferior service. Why? Because we live in an area that is simply not covered by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_to_the_x">FTTC</a> technology. That seems unfair to say the least, yet when the question is asked of BT, their answer is often the same: it comes down to the business case. They will simply not extend the reach of their FTTC offering because it is cost prohibitive.</p>

<h2 id="who-costs-the-most">Who costs the most?</h2>

<p>Let’s think about this for a minute. While I accept that I am probably simplifying things greatly here, the costs to BT for each customer will come down to the several major groupings: ISP running costs, bandwidth, network infrastructure, and exchange hardware. So how might these costs vary between users on ADSL and Infinity products?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It will cost the same to run as an ISP whether your user is on ADSL or Infinity. The cost of an email accounts, support, portals, etc should all be the same. If anything support for Infinity users will be higher as this is the newer technology, and more prone to confusion and problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bandwidth costs should be the same to them although it could easily be argued that a user on a fast Infinity connection will consume more of your bandwidth, certainly on “unlimited” allowance packages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Network infrastructure is where things will differ. Backhaul should be the same, but paying for new fibre cabinets and the fibre optic cabling to them costs a lot. The network infrastructure is the same as it always was for ADSL users, it’s only the new Infinity users that incur this cost.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exchange hardware will also see a large difference. ADSL hardware is available in most, if not all exchanges, and would likely have been paid for at this stage, less some ongoing maintenance costs. Conversely, the Infinity hardware is new and expensive, and is where the real cost lies.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I think it’s fair to say that it costs a lot more to sustain a customer on an Infinity package over a customer on regular ADSL, yet both sets of customers pay the same price. I think that what <a href="http://wispa.it/">wispa</a> should be campaigning for is not only an end to the “up to” problem, but that customers on older, inferior products should not be effectively subsidising customers who take a newer, superior product.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, often when I ask BT why they don’t offer me Infinity, they say it’s because there is no business case for it. They say it’s not economically viable.</p>

<p>I now say - why don’t you use the excess money you get from me paying the same price as an Infinity service, and instead of treating it as profit, treat it as a down-payment on the new hardware you need to provide me with a better service. Maybe <a href="http://wispa.it/">wispa</a> can adapt this into their campaign as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There’s been a bit of discussion on the <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5 Network</a> recently about the lack of upgrades on the Mac App Store sparked by a recent blog post on the subject by <a href="http://blog.wilshipley.com/2012/03/mac-app-store-needs-paid-upgrades.html">Wil Shipley</a>.</p>

<p>I see this from both sides. As a consumer I naturally want software to be as cheap as possible, and I can’t deny that the concept of “free upgrades for life” is not appealing. Yet, on the flip side I write software for a living, and the idea of getting paid once and having no upgrade revenue stream is not a nice one.</p>

<p>The folks at 5by5 (specifically <a href="http://siracusa.tumblr.com/">John Siracusa</a> and <a href="http://marco.org/">Marco Arment</a>) have covered most of the salient points, so I recommend having a listen back to the latest episodes of <em><a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/">Hypercritical</a></em> and <em><a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/">Build and Analyze</a></em>.</p>

<p>Some of the discussion has pointed out that one possible option is for a developer to release “version 2” as a new application and remove the previous version of the application from sale. This has two drawbacks for existing users (which have been debated at length, but I’ll recap):</p>

<ul>
  <li>if they want to upgrade they feel cheated at having to pay for a new app without the availability of an upgrade discount;</li>
  <li>if they chose not to upgrade they are unable to get application updates for their existing application as it has been pulled from the store.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="discounted-upgrades-are-gone">Discounted upgrades are gone</h2>

<p>First things first - I think that the old pricing model of a high initial purchase price followed by discounted upgrades is probably gone, and a natural successor would appear to be a consistent price for new and upgrade purchases.</p>

<p>There will inevitably be some pushback on this. Developers won’t like it for the obvious reason - their initial revenue will be lower and they’ll be forced to think longer term. This is a completely natural reaction and it will probably take some major players to set the trend - maybe this is where Apple are leading with their own price drops as they move applications into the App Stores.</p>

<p>I feel that this is a good way to work though it will require a bit of thought from app developers with regard to their longer term strategies - it’s about taking lower margins with higher volumes. It’s about taking a lower purchase price for the initial version but actually taking a higher “upgrade” price for subsequent versions.</p>

<p>Customer opinion could be divided depending on whether they are new or existing customers. New customers will love the fact that the initial prices seem lower - they’ll feel that they’re getting a bargain. Existing customers will hate the fact that they have to pay the same amount for upgrades as new customers will pay.</p>

<p>Overall it’s still a good deal for the customer. They will be buying into an ecosystem which places emphasis on long-term investment in software. Increased volumes means lower prices on average. And of course, paying for upgrades <em>should</em> ultimately mean higher quality software.</p>

<h2 id="maintaining-multiple-versions">Maintaining multiple versions</h2>

<p>Of course, this discussion is still meaningless when the App Stores don’t offer a good way to maintain multiple versions of a product.</p>

<p>If a developer followed the model above and charged the same price for each version (i.e. no discounted upgrades) there is still the dilemma about whether to leave multiple versions in the store at once. As a developer I find this unappealing because it leads to confusion amongst potential purchasers. Yet removing the old version is not really an option as it has a negative impact on customers who don’t want to upgrade for at least two reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are unable to get bug fixes to a product they paid for;</li>
  <li>if they move to a new computer they are unable to re-download a product that they still legitimately own.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is where Apple need to make a change to the App Stores. If they won’t go to the trouble of implementing upgrades, then I propose that they give developers the  opportunity to mark an app as being “retired”.</p>

<p>A retired app should no longer be purchasable by new customers. In fact it should not appear in the App Store to people who do not already have the app in their purchase history. Only those who have purchased it before should be able to re-download it to a new computer, or obtain updates.</p>

<p>This still isn’t a completely straightforward process for developers (or for customers) as the new version is technically a different application, and as such poses issues for data migration between versions. Also customers will need to be informed of new versions, possibly through annoying alert dialogs in the old version.</p>

<p>Still, if Apple allowed applications to be marked as “retired” this would be a big start. In the meantime, you could always raise the price of your old version to $999.99…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jeff Atwood recently wrote a <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/04/books-bits-vs-atoms.html">fantastic piece on the current standard of eBooks</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because I love words, I want to love eBooks. I want to buy lots and lots of eBooks. But unless the publishers are willing to treat eBooks with the same respect and care that they give to their printed books – and most importantly of all, adjust their pricing to reflect the brave new economy of bits, and not an antiquated economy of atoms – they’re destined to eventually suffer the same fate as the Encyclopedia Britannica.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This article couldn’t be more correct.</p>

<p>I’ve recently decided to stop buying print books under most circumstances<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> for reasons that include both personal convenience, and a desire to consume less resources.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as Jeff has pointed out, eBooks just aren’t 100% there yet. Traditional novels are fine from Kindle/iBookstore, but I read a lot of technology books, and the instant you get into screenshots or diagrams the formatting goes straight out the window. Many of the tech-related publishers are providing the option to go for PDF instead but this still feels like settling for second-best until they get their act together.</p>

<p>For me this sums up everything that there is to being a dad. When the subject of bicycle helmets came up in the past, I always swore that I’d never wear one. I trotted out the old fallback position of “I never needed one when I was a kid, I don’t need one now, and my kids will never need one either.”</p>

<p>Now that I’m actually a dad, my position has changed. From here on I’ll do whatever is necessary to set a good example for my daughter. How times changes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While listening to the recent <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/">Mac Power Users</a> podcast on <a href="http://macpowerusers.com/2012/04/mpu-79-hazel-3-0/">using Hazel</a> I got the impression that host <a href="http://www.katiefloyd.me/">Katie Floyd</a> wasn’t a fan of using the Mac Desktop as a storage location for files.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I’ve heard this opinion before - often accompanied with disparaging remarks suggesting that it is an uncouth and savage practice, befitting more of Windows users than of elegant and refined Mac users. This just isn’t the case - for a start Windows users are people too, and just think about it: if we weren’t supposed to use the Desktop, why would Apple have made it just a regular folder?</p>

<p>I can be a bit of a cleanliness freak when it comes to my hard disks<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> but surprisingly I’m actually a fan of throwing documents on the Desktop as a working storage area. If I’m working on a document, downloading some material or even just trying something out I tend to leave things on the Desktop while I’m working on them.</p>

<p>I see this as being akin to the real world - when I’m working with paper documents I tend to spread them around me in order to have the material within easy reach. I want to be able to do the same with the Mac Desktop so that I don’t have to root around in folders for the relevant files.</p>

<h2 id="too-much-hassle">Too Much Hassle?</h2>

<p>I guess some people might find it tough working with the Mac Desktop. Sometimes it can be hard to arrange windows so that you can quickly open documents or move them about, especially when it comes to Macs with smaller displays like MacBook Pros and Airs.</p>

<p>My advice to people is to take advantage of Exposé - especially on newer Macs with gesture support. I use the “Spread with thumb and three fingers” gesture to access the Desktop and have immediate access to my files for double-clicking or drag-and-drop operations.</p>

<p>Admittedly dragging and dropping can be troublesome at times. To drop into an open application you generally need to drag the item over the dock icon for the application, wait for it to show the open windows for the application and then hold the item over the desired window until it comes to the foreground. This can be cumbersome, so it’s worth grabbing <a href="http://www.eternalstorms.at/yoink/">Yoink</a> from the Mac App Store. Once installed it provides a handy tray you can drag onto quickly, then Cmd-Tab (or otherwise navigate) to your desired application and drag from the Yoink tray into the application.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-it-under-control">Keeping It Under Control</h2>

<p>Of course, there’s always a danger that your Desktop can get out of control if you start using it for multiple active projects. The best way to combat this is with a bit of discipline, but if you need a hand you can always turn to Hazel for some help.</p>

<p>At present I use a two-level indicator as to the relevance of a file on the desktop. After two days of inactivity Hazel marks a file with an Orange label so that I can see that it hasn’t been used recently. After a further two days of inactivity Hazel marks the file with a Red label as a final warning.</p>

<p>Ideally though my desktop would be reasonably clear at the end of every day so that I can start from scratch every morning. Again Hazel could come to the rescue, by automatically clearing items from the desktop at the end of the working day. The rule shown below is the start of a system for implementing this:</p>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2012/04/blue_rule.png" alt="Blue Rule" /></p>

<p>The idea here is that I can have multiple projects organised according to label colour. At the end of the working day Hazel will sweep all files on the Desktop with a Blue label into the Blue folder. The next time I go to work on the project I can just drag the items back onto the Desktop to start again. It’s a bit like keeping your real life working papers in boxes - at the end of the day you just sweep the papers off the desktop and into the box. Next day, dump the contents of the box onto the nice clean desktop.</p>

<p>See - working on the Desktop is not just for savages.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>John Gruber added an <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/04/09/itunes-match">update to this post</a> in which he explained that he had mixed the terms <em>iTunes Match</em> and <em>iTunes in the Cloud</em>. I think the easiest way to differentiate is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">iCloud</a></strong>: this is Apple’s overall cloud strategy that encompasses the ability to store application data and a media locker in the cloud;</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/features/">iTunes in the Cloud</a></strong>: this is the iCloud component that allows you to re-download material from your media locker. This includes books, apps, music, TV shows and (depending on where you are) movies;</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-match/">iTunes Match</a></strong>: this is the subscription service by which Apple allow you to music files not originally purchased from iTunes to your media locker.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe it’s not 100% accurate, but it’s enough to keep it straight in my mind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a recent article about the Flashback Trojan that’s been infecting many Macs Arik Hesseldahl at AllThingsD led off with the title <em><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120406/whats-this-a-mac-virus-no-actually-its-a-weakness-in-java/">What’s This? A Mac Virus? No, Actually It’s a Weakness in Java</a></em>. Intentional or not, this title contains the suggestion that it’s not Apple’s fault, it’s Oracle’s (with a hint of “Macs are still invulnerable” thrown in for good measure).</p>

<p>He’s right of course - it’s not a Mac virus. (If we want to be pedantic it’s not even a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus">virus</a>, it’s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)">trojan</a>.) But Arik goes on to try to diminish the importance of this trojan, and worse, he seems to try to admonish Apple of their responsibility:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does that let Apple off the hook entirely? No, though to its credit, Apple had a fix ready within a week of learning of this vulnerability. That’s not exactly a pokey response, especially when the problem lies not directly within Apple’s software, but in Oracle’s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The exploit in Java that is used by the Flashback Trojan has existed for some time. It was reported in September 2011 in <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3544">CVE-2011-3544</a> and Oracle themselves <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpuoct2011-443431.html">put out patched Java runtimes</a> in October 2011.</p>

<p>Contrary to the quote above, rather than getting a patch out within a week, Apple have actually sat on this one for a long time. Disappointingly they only released their updates after the <a href="http://news.drweb.com/show/?i=2341">initial announcement</a> by Dr. Web caused the story to blow up.</p>

<p>So, Arik, let’s not give Apple any credit on this one. The current estimate is 600,000 Macs infected with this malware. Yes, it’s an Java vulnerability, but it is Apple who distributes the Java runtime for OS X, not Oracle. They had the opportunity to fix this in a timely fashion, and chose not to, putting many of their customers systems at risk by not doing so.</p>

<p>Rather than deserving credit, I rather think they owe their customers instead.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> is an amazing place. There are so many diverse projects hosted there, and it’s fantastic to be able to quickly create a repo and share code with the world. I’ve been a member for just under a year, and in that time I’ve gone from just downloading other people’s projects, to forking and contributing to Open Source projects, to creating my own public and private repositories.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with GitHub and it’s pricing plans, you’ll know that you can create unlimited public projects with an unlimited number of contributors for free. This is probably one of the reasons why GitHub has become a de facto standard for public projects<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>About eight months ago I started working on some personal projects, which I just wasn’t prepared to share with the world. I did some due diligence had a look at the various options available to me (including <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> and <a href="http://beanstalkapp.com/">Beanstalk</a>), and made the decision to pay for the GitHub Micro account (at $7 per month). I don’t regret that decision, as I think GitHub was definitely the best option at the time.</p>

<p>Things are different now though. In October last year <a href="http://blog.bitbucket.org/2011/10/03/bitbucket-now-rocks-git/">BitBucket announced</a> that they were now going to offer support for Git repositories (prior to that they’d only had a <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> offering). This was a pretty big deal for many potential users and they offer a very attractive pricing scheme to sweeten the deal.</p>

<p>With GitHub I was getting 5 private repos and 1 collaborator for $7 per month. With <a href="https://bitbucket.org/plans">BitBucket</a> I can get unlimited private repos with 5 collaborators for free. I also get tighter integration with Atlassian’s <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview">JIRA</a>, which I use for issue tracking over the GitHub system. At first glance this seems like a no-brainer, except…</p>

<h2 id="community">Community</h2>

<p>There’s only one real problem with BitBucket. It’s not GitHub. Don’t get me wrong, <a href="http://www.pocoo.org/~blackbird/github-vs-bitbucket/bitbucket.html">it tries very hard to be GitHub</a>, but there’s one area where GitHub beats the competition hands down - community.</p>

<p>GitHub is home to so many public projects that it’s the natural place to fork a project or create a new one. There is no way that I know of to fork/pull request between GitHub and BitBucket. It’s also hard to justify moving public repos from GitHub when people who may find them use might not want to fork on a “smaller” site like BitBucket.</p>

<p>As of today, I’ve imported my private repos into BitBucket, and have downgraded my GitHub account. Anything I want to keep private will now go to BitBucket, and I’m going public only on GitHub. If I want to fork a project I’ll do it on GitHub, or if I want to share a repo making it as easy as possible for other people to use, I’ll do that on GitHub as well.</p>

<p>I was concerned that some of my private projects wouldn’t move to BitBucket cleanly - I have a couple of Xcode projects that utilise Open Source frameworks to provide core functionality. I’ve already forked these on GitHub and I didn’t want to lose that flexibility. Thankfully Git submodules allows me to get the best of both worlds. Even though my parent repos now originate on BitBucket, I was still able to define submodules which are originated on GitHub with no ill effects.</p>

<p>Now, GitHub, please don’t announce any pricing plan changes for the next few months so that I can at least get settled in over at BitBucket.</p>

      <p>That and the fact that forking/pull requests is a great model for controlled collaboration. Oh, and Git has been flavour of the month for SCM for a while now.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
  <p>…of all the people I have talked to in the past two years about the iPad no one ever asked me about a smaller version.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Federico Viticci <a href="http://ticci.org/seven">briefly responds</a> to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/05/seven-inch-ipad/">MG Siegler’s article <em>Seven</em></a>.</p>

<p>I was surprised when Siegler wrote that people were saying they wished there was a smaller version of the iPad. I hang around with a lot of nerds, and even they haven’t really been “wishing” for a smaller iPad until the <a href="http://www.appadvice.com/appnn/2012/03/apple-has-163-reasons-to-release-fabled-ipad-mini">rumour mill started cranking recently</a>.</p>

<p>Viticci’s previous post on the subject sums it up for me when it comes to a 7.85” model - <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/when-it-comes-to-7-85-ipad-the-question-is-why/">“Why?”</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subscriber_line">DSL</a> is the most popular broadband Internet access method in the UK as it is one of the few methods available across the majority of the country. Cable services are largely restricted to the cities, and high speed wireless is often a disappointment in reality. </p>

<p>While symmetric DSL is available in some areas, the sensible decision was taken during the late nineties/early “noughties” to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_digital_subscriber_line">asymmetric DSL</a> as the default (and often only) option. ADSL results in a small portion of the available bandwidth being used for upload capacity, and the remaining bandwidth being used for download capacity. There are technical reasons supporting the asymmetry, and also practical reasons that were beneficial for the user experience.</p>

<p>At the time it was fair to say that users downloaded a lot more data than they uploaded. Few people ran home servers, the usage of cloud services was limited, and the ISPs wanted to discourage peer-to-peer file sharing - what better way than by limiting upload speeds.</p>

<p>Times change and nowadays home broadband users want to be able to run personal home servers (e.g. for accessing media from outside the home), they want to host online games, they want to use cloud storage for their personal files.</p>

<p>ISPs have acknowledged this to some extent, and most “super-fast” broadband services come with a generous upload bandwidth. This is great, but as usual brings no benefit to those of us out of range of these services.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s time for ISPs to start getting a bit more symmetrical with their offerings for the second-class citizens. I rarely need the full 5.5Mbps download speed I can achieve with my broadband service, but am constantly maxing out the 440kbps upload speed I am limited to. I’m not asking to run a popular web-site from home, but I do want to be able to reliably “live in the cloud”. Like the first-class citizens who were blessed with the “super-fast” broadband.</p>
