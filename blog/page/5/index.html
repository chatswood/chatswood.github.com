  <div class="entry-content"><p>After recently switching to a pre-paid mobile service I’ve been a bit more aware of how much things cost. We recently took a trip to Dublin which involves roaming and being cost-conscious I ensured my iPhone had <em>Data Roaming</em> disabled. Unfortunately we got a bit lost for a while and I had to turn on the tap for a while to use Google Maps.</p>

<p>I was sure I hadn’t used much data, but when I got home I checked my usage and found that I’d spent over £8 checking Google Maps for a couple of minutes. Admittedly Orange had warned me it would cost £4/MB but I couldn’t see how I’d used that much. Then I realised that there were probably some background tasks using the network connection which I didn’t have much control over.</p>

<h2 id="location-location-location">Location Location Location</h2>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2011/08/location.png" alt="location.png" /></p>

<p>The <em>Location Services</em> section of the iOS <em>Settings</em> app is a prime example of how to get that kind of control. Instead of having a single on-off control I’d love to see the ability to enable roaming services for specific apps and services.</p>

<p>Yes, I know. I could just disable background checking of email and disable push notifications. However that means I’ve got to go back and re-enable all those services again once I’m back home. I want that control in a menu that only applies to roaming allowing me to leave those settings for the next time I head over the border.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Matt Asay wrote a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/16/asay_on_goole_patents_and_apple/">generally interesting article</a> on the Motorola Mobility acquisition by Google but this stood out as a strange and flawed argument: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second, it’s critical to remember who buys Android devices versus iOS 
devices: kids buy Android (“It’s cheap!”) while adults largely buy iOS 
(“Pricey, but it makes me cool with the other soccer dads!”). Guess 
which group will be buying devices long into the future?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry Matt, but you’ve made a big assumption here that “kids” will continue buying the cheap devices even when they can afford to buy the pricey ones. Many people I know who own Android devices fall into one of two categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They can’t afford an iOS device right now but would consider jumping ship to iOS if they could afford it.</li>
  <li>They dislike Apple and persist in using an unsatisfactory device as though making a stand.</li>
</ol>

<p>Otherwise, a decent article highlighting the idiocy of the mobile patent arms race, spoiled by a small dose of fanboi-baiting. Dammit. It obviously worked.</p>

![iCloud] (http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2011/06/icloud.png)
&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<p>This week Apple announced their new iCloud service, and one facet that particularly intrigued me was the availability of <em>iTunes in the Cloud</em>. I’ll let Apple describe the concept:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>With iCloud, the music you purchase in iTunes appears 
automatically on all your devices. You can also download your 
past iTunes purchases. Where you want, when you want.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seemed like it would save a lot of headaches for me. I currently keep a stash of over 100GB of MP3s; over 9000 individual tracks; over 28 hours of listening. Ripping it all was a labour of love. The files are stored on a NAS drive and I keep a copy of every song on each of my 3 Macs<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I also have a number of iOS devices to get the music onto.</p>

<p>So this is what I do every time I buy a new CD:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rip, encode and tag the CD on my Mac Pro;</li>
  <li>Copy the files to the NAS;</li>
  <li>Import the files into iTunes on my Mac Pro;</li>
  <li>Copy the files from the NAS to my Mac Mini;</li>
  <li>Import the files into iTunes on my Mac Mini;</li>
  <li>Copy the files from the NAS to my MacBook Pro;</li>
  <li>Import the files into iTunes on my MacBook Pro;</li>
  <li>Sync the files from iTunes onto my iPhone;</li>
  <li>Sync the files from iTunes onto my iPad;</li>
  <li>Relax.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we are to believe Apple’s marketing material, this should soon be simplified to the following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rip, encode and tag the CD on my Mac Pro;</li>
  <li>Copy the files to the NAS (simply as a backup);</li>
  <li>Import the files into iTunes on my Mac Pro;</li>
  <li>Allow iTunes to send info on the new files up to iCloud;</li>
  <li>Relax (while the new tracks are synced automatically to my Mac Mini, MacBook Pro, iPhone and iPad).</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, with this level of convenience I’d almost be tempted to just buy the tracks through iTunes in the first place and forget about the hassle of ordering, ripping and storing those old-fashioned CDs.</p>

<h2 id="not-so-fast">Not so fast…</h2>

<p>If you go to <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/icloud/features/">Apple’s UK iCloud page</a> there is an asterisk in the service description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>With iCloud, the music you purchase in iTunes appears 
automatically on all your devices. You can also download your 
past iTunes purchases.* Where you want, when you want.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This asterisk informs us that the service is <em>“Starting in the US”</em>.</p>

<p>This is disappointing in itself but <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/8565587/Apples-iTunes-in-iCloud-wont-launch-in-the-UK-this-year.html">emerging reports</a> from the UK press now suggest a delay until 2012: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A spokesman for the Performing Right Society (PRS), which ensures that composers, 
songwriters and music publishers are paid for their work, told The Telegraph, that 
negotiations with Apple about ensuring rights in the UK had started but were at a 
“very early stage”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How long do these publishing companies think it is acceptable to treat their customers with such contempt? Why do they get away with treating some territories as second-class citizens?</p>

<p>I pay for my CDs the same way that someone from the US pays for their CDs. Why does the US citizen get access to that music through Apple’s iCloud service and I don’t?</p>

<p>The answer I expect is probably going to come down to some excuse about the fact that I don’t own the music I bought, I simply licensed it. I’m just not quite sure when I agreed to that license. It doesn’t say anything on the CD case. I bought the CD under the same conditions that someone in the US bought their CD under. How come their license is different?</p>

<p>For now I guess I just have to look on enviously while my US counterparts enjoy the iCloud. Hopefully the outlook will be cloudy for us in the rest of the world in the near future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I took the plunge and tried updating my iPhone 4 to iOS 5. I marvelled at the shiny new process which allows untethered activation.</p>

<p>I then got frustrated when presented with the following message:</p>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2011-06-07/phone_error.jpg" alt="iPhone error" /></p>

<p>But wait! It says on the screen that I can connect the iPhone to iTunes to activate it the old-fashioned way. Salvation!</p>

<p>And then:</p>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2011-06-07/itunes_error.png" alt="iTunes error" /></p>

<p>Great.</p>

<p>Thankfully I got it resolved by borrowing an unlocked SIM card - once inserted into the iPhone the activation server started working again. I can’t tell if it was the unlocked SIM or a coincidental re-appearance of the activation server which did the trick.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="aka-how-to-lose-1000-pounds-overnight">(aka How to lose 1000 pounds overnight)</h2>

<p>I recently decided to splurge on one of the new 2011 MacBook Pros, and am very glad I did. My 2007 MBP has served me well and I’ve been very pleased with it’s performance over the years, but there were a few reasons why I thought I could justify ditching the older model:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it was out of warranty;</li>
  <li>the fans were coming on more frequently with daily work;</li>
  <li>the battery was only lasting a paltry 2-3 hours (after 2 replacements);</li>
  <li>it was feeling a bit heavy for carrying to work every day;</li>
  <li>the 15” screen was feeling like overkill;</li>
  <li>it was taking too much room in my bag.</li>
</ul>

<p>It might seem a bit flamboyant, but I was spending about 12 hours a day on my MBP. I was carrying it to and from work 4-5 days a week. I was carting it about the house in the evening, having to find the charger, trying to keep it cool.</p>

<p>It was just becoming a lot less fun.</p>

<p>So I did <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/03/13-i7-macbook-pro-review.ars">my research</a>, got the finances in order and then went ahead and purchased the new 13” Core-i5 2011 MBP.</p>

<p>I’m now under warranty again and have a machine that can cope with my workload, and yet is not too heavy a load for me to use or carry about. I was concerned about losing the screen resolution, but it hasn’t been too bad so far (especially as I’m working attached to a monitor during the working day).</p>

<h2 id="the-apple-tv-just-stayed-the-same">The Apple TV just stayed the same!</h2>

<p>With the rollout of iOS 4.3 yesterday US owners of the Apple TV found that not only do they enjoy the availability of NetFlix on their devices but they now also get access to MLB (baseball) and NBA<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> (basketball).</p>

<p>It’s great that Apple are actively working to provide extra services for these devices but it would be nice if they would try thinking about territories other than the USA.</p>

<p>To pre-empt the obvious rebuttals to this post:</p>

<ul>
  <li>yes - Apple are an American company;</li>
  <li>yes - the USA is a huge market compared to the UK;</li>
  <li>yes - licensing agreements are hard enough to negotiate in one country never mind globally;</li>
  <li>yes - baseball is hardly worth jumping up and down about.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe something better will be coming soon. Right now though, it feels that the sleek little black box under the TV holds a world of potential that’s just not being realised.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve just read two articles on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/">BBC News site</a> - one was about the imminent arrival of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12339494">another winter storm</a> in the US, and the other was about Queenslanders being told to flee the arrival of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12342031">the strongest cyclone</a> in their history.</p>

<p>This is not long after the worst flooding in Queensland’s history, mudslides in Brazil which claimed hundreds of lives, and a number of other extreme weather events which have made the international headlines. Closer to home, we’ve had the lowest winter temperatures on record - these do not compare to the devastation that has occurred elsewhere, but its an indicator that our weather is changing.</p>

<p>So is this down to climate change? Have we finally done so much damage that the apocalypse is upon us? Or is it just that these things happen, and we’re now paying more attention to it?</p>

<p>Personally I think it’s a combination of both. Talk of global warming and climate change has caused us to pay more attention to news stories about extreme weather. It has caused the media to report more than they would have previously. And the natural progress of technology means that we’re now able to receive and consume more news than ever before.</p>

<p>At the same time, there does seem to be an undeniable change in the climate (both locally and globally). Whether<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> this is down to man-made global warming, or due to natural climate cycles I could not say. All I know is that we can’t rule either out.</p>

<p>I just hope that we get used to these changes sooner rather than later, and learn to cope with them in order to spare lives.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A long time ago I stumbled across the artist <a href="http://udosson.com/">Udosson</a> through his <a href="http://soundcloud.com/udosson">SoundCloud profile</a>. I always found his music to be a perfect combination of organic sounding synths and machine-like rhythms. I’d always listened to his tracks in isolation but recently I decided to lay down some cash for his 2010 album <em>Kurz Unter Land</em> (helpfully translated as “off-shore” by the kind souls at Udosson’s label <a href="http://petite-unique.de/">Petite:Unique</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>).</p>

<p>The music itself is predominantly ambient in nature and takes in clicky percussions, swelling pads and beautiful samples. Some of it is reminiscent of Hans Zimmer’s work on the Inception soundtrack while other portions remind me of the more ambient tracks from The Aphex Twin’s Drukqs album. I really recommend that you have a listen to this material at Udosson’s <a href="http://soundcloud.com/udosson">SoundCloud profile</a> and buy it if you like it.</p>
