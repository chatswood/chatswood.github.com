  <div class="entry-content"><h2>The Apple TV just got better!</h2>

<p>&#8230;unless of course, you&#8217;re in the UK<a href="Or">^1</a>, in which case&#8230;</p>

<h2>The Apple TV just stayed the same!</h2>

<p>With the rollout of iOS 4.3 yesterday US owners of the Apple TV found that not only do they enjoy the availability of NetFlix on their devices but they now also get access to MLB (baseball) and NBA<a href="Update:">^2</a> (basketball).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s great that Apple are actively working to provide extra services for these devices but it would be nice if they would try thinking about territories other than the USA.</p>

<p>To pre-empt the obvious rebuttals to this post:</p>

<ul>
<li>yes - Apple are an American company;</li>
<li>yes - the USA is a huge market compared to the UK;</li>
<li>yes - licensing agreements are hard enough to negotiate in one country never mind globally;</li>
<li>yes - baseball is hardly worth jumping up and down about.<a href="Sorry,">^3</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Maybe something better will be coming soon. Right now though, it feels that the sleek little black box under the TV holds a world of potential that&#8217;s just not being realised.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just read two articles on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/">BBC News site</a> - one was about the imminent arrival of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12339494">another winter storm</a> in the US, and the other was about Queenslanders being told to flee the arrival of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12342031">the strongest cyclone</a> in their history.</p>

<p>This is not long after the worst flooding in Queensland&#8217;s history, mudslides in Brazil which claimed hundreds of lives, and a number of other extreme weather events which have made the international headlines. Closer to home, we&#8217;ve had the lowest winter temperatures on record - these do not compare to the devastation that has occurred elsewhere, but its an indicator that our weather is changing.</p>

<p>So is this down to climate change? Have we finally done so much damage that the apocalypse is upon us? Or is it just that these things happen, and we&#8217;re now paying more attention to it?</p>

<p>Personally I think it&#8217;s a combination of both. Talk of global warming and climate change has caused us to pay more attention to news stories about extreme weather. It has caused the media to report more than they would have previously. And the natural progress of technology means that we&#8217;re now able to receive and consume more news than ever before.</p>

<p>At the same time, there does seem to be an undeniable change in the climate (both locally and globally). Whether<a href="Sorry,">^1</a> this is down to man-made global warming, or due to natural climate cycles I could not say. All I know is that we can&#8217;t rule either out.</p>

<p>I just hope that we get used to these changes sooner rather than later, and learn to cope with them in order to spare lives.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A long time ago I stumbled across the artist <a href="http://udosson.com/">Udosson</a> through his <a href="http://soundcloud.com/udosson">SoundCloud profile</a>. I always found his music to be a perfect combination of organic sounding synths and machine-like rhythms. I&#8217;d always listened to his tracks in isolation but recently I decided to lay down some cash for his 2010 album <em>Kurz Unter Land</em> (helpfully translated as &#8220;off-shore&#8221; by the kind souls at Udosson&#8217;s label <a href="http://petite-unique.de/">Petite:Unique</a><a href="Nice">^1</a>).</p>

<p>The music itself is predominantly ambient in nature and takes in clicky percussions, swelling pads and beautiful samples. Some of it is reminiscent of Hans Zimmer&#8217;s work on the Inception soundtrack while other portions remind me of the more ambient tracks from The Aphex Twin&#8217;s Drukqs album. I really recommend that you have a listen to this material at Udosson&#8217;s <a href="http://soundcloud.com/udosson">SoundCloud profile</a> and buy it if you like it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On first sighting of Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/airplay/">AirPlay</a> technology I was initially impressed but wasn&#8217;t sure how much it offered over their existing AirTunes facilities which I&#8217;d been using with Airport Express/Apple TV (the first one) for some time. This weekend I got to use AirPlay &#8220;properly&#8221; for the first time.</p>

<p>I wanted to listen to another of the excellent <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5 Studios</a> podcasts which I had on my iPhone. I had a few options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Listen on the iPhone using headphones;</li>
<li>Listen on the iPhone using the built-in speaker;</li>
<li>Listen on the iPhone plugged into an external set of speakers;</li>
<li>Listen on the Apple TV attached to the HD TV;</li>
</ul>


<h2>The problems</h2>

<p>Using headphones for the iPhone just didn&#8217;t seem like a good option - I was looking after my daughter at the time and headphones would have gotten in the way and are a very attractive proposition for someone who is still investigating this new world by sticking things in her mouth and seeing what they taste like.</p>

<p>The iPhone&#8217;s built-in speaker is reasonable, but wasn&#8217;t quite enough to overcome the volume levels exhibited in the shrieks of a 5-month old girl who has been denied another opportunity to stick a remote control into her mouth.</p>

<p>I could have plugged the iPhone into a trusty set of external speakers which would have overcome all of the pitfalls posed by my daughter. Unfortunately that meant leaving the iPhone on the other side of the room and would have denied me the comforting feeling I get when I know the Internet is always within my easy reach.</p>

<p>The final option was to forget the iPhone and instead start up my Apple TV and stick on the HD TV in order to listen to an audio-only podcast. Unfortunately our most recent electricity bill was so big that I&#8217;m still on the resulting energy efficiency kick. I really didn&#8217;t want to turn on the Apple TV (about 17W) and the HD TV (about 150W) just to listen to audio.</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>And so to the rescue comes AirPlay. In the same room I had the afore-mentioned external speakers, and an Airport Express. I fired up the iPhone and started the podcast playing then selected the Airport Express as the target for the audio. After a small delay (about a second) Dan Benjamin&#8217;s voice was coming out of my speakers.</p>

<p>I still had the iPhone in hand and could surf at will. I could hear the podcast over my daughter&#8217;s vocal contributions. I was saving money by not using the TV wastefully.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I say &#8220;Mmm AirPlay I Love You&#8221;.<a href="For">^1</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love <a href="http://www.macstories.net/">MacStories</a> and just about everything that Federico Viticci writes, but I have to disagree with some aspects of this post defending <a href="http://www.sophiestication.com/">Sophiestication</a> and the <a href="http://www.sophiestication.com/coversutra/">CoverSutra</a> debacle.</p>

<p>Firstly I agree with Federico - verbally abusing the developer is not necessary and is completely wrong.</p>

<p>Where I disagree is when Federico alludes that this situation was a by-product of the Mac App Store policies: <em>&#8220;I believe Sophia is yet another victim of Apple’s policy when it comes to the Mac App Store, and she’s just being accused first.&#8221;</em> The problem with CoverSutra was not the transition to the Mac App Store or it&#8217;s policies but is actually with the fact that Sophia (the developer of CoverSutra) decided to cut off her existing customers.</p>

<p>Sophia chose to move to the Mac App Store exclusively and to not maintain two builds. She fell victim to her own policy and not to Apple&#8217;s. Sure, she may have forgotten about the promise she made, but she should consider herself reminded.</p>

<p>I get the fact that as a small developer the overhead of maintaining two builds is not to be easily absorbed, but she made the choice to ditch one of those builds. Unfortunately she chose the one that her existing customers paid for her to use until she delivered on the free upgrade to version 3.0 that she promised.</p>

<p>I feel for Sophia, cause she has a big decision now:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stick with the Mac App Store, alienate her existing customers and tarnish her reputation, in the hope that new customers through the Mac App Store can overcome the setbacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Revert to two builds - an overhead sure, but maybe less costly than the hit to her reputation.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Either of these options is going to cost her and her company to some extent. Personally, I think she should take the second option - the Internet community can be a cruel and unforgiving bunch.</p>

<p>One more thing - Federico wrote <em>&#8220;I think this is a problem of self-entitlement with some users&#8221;</em> - maybe it is, maybe it&#8217;s not. These users feel that they paid for free upgrades up to an including version 3.0. Is this what Sophia sold?<a href="I">^1</a> If so, then surely it&#8217;s not self-entitlement for people to expect what they paid for.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/">Mac App Store</a> has launched and there doesn&#8217;t appear to have been any major disasters.</p>

<p>Much to my relief it has been possible to purchase a paid app (e.g. the new <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/imovie/id408981434?mt=12">iMovie 11</a>) and not only install it on my user account on another Mac, but also to use it in my wife&#8217;s user account on both Macs. This was my big concern which seems to have been unfounded. However, it&#8217;s early days yet and by all accounts not all developers have been properly checking receipts so far which means the situation could change. I&#8217;m feeling fairly confident given that I&#8217;ve tested it with Apple&#8217;s own offerings.</p>

<h2>Available apps</h2>

<p>The range of apps available so far is quite small in comparison to the &#8220;free market&#8221; and the iOS App Store, but that&#8217;s only to be expected. The pleasant surprise was to see so many familiar names like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/omnifocus-for-mac/id402835630?mt=12">OmniFocus</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/marsedit/id402376225?mt=12">MarsEdit</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ibank/id402422773?mt=12">iBank</a>, as well as the expected Apple favourites like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewRoom?fcId=412904350&amp;mt=12&amp;id=29562.">iWork</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewRoom?fcId=412904253&amp;mt=12&amp;id=29562">iLife 11</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest surprise for me was the fact that <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/aperture/id408981426?mt=12">Aperture</a> is selling through the Mac App Store for just £44.99. Given that Apple are still selling the boxed version<a href="I">^1</a> for £173 through the Apple Store it&#8217;s an amazing deal. Given the prices I&#8217;ve paid since Aperture 1.5 (£220 + £79 for the 2.0 upgrade + £79 for the 3.0 upgrade!) it smarts slightly, but it&#8217;s great to see the price point reduce for an invaluable tool, and hopefully it will drive uptake and lead to renewed vigour on the applications development.</p>

<h2>Confusion</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s not all been plain sailing. There&#8217;s a bit of confusion out there about the fact that the Mac App Store application detects your previously licensed software as being installed. It&#8217;s not clear if this is a bug or intentional, but it is causing people to ask the question <em>&#8220;If the Mac App Store can tell that I have the software installed, can it update it for me?&#8221;</em> The answer is made pretty clear at this site: <a href="http://ifiboughtyourappalreadycaniupdateitthroughthemacappstore.com/">http://ifiboughtyourappalreadycaniupdateitthroughthemacappstore.com/</a> Basically the apps are detected as installed because they share the same bundle ID. Unfortunately they are usually different builds<a href="The">^1.5</a> of the software which just report themselves to be the same. In short - unless you bought it through the Mac App Store, you can&#8217;t update it through the Mac App Store.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also no way to uninstall apps through this new interface. While it&#8217;s still as easy to remove apps by dragging them to the trash, it&#8217;s not the polished solution I was hoping for. One of the obvious reasons for the Mac App Store was the fact that it reduced the hell that .dmg files could be for inexperienced users. Job done, but it still doesn&#8217;t make it any easier for the same users to remove software that they no longer want (especially as the Mac App Store makes it so much easier to download free and cheap apps to clutter our /Applications folder).</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s been a good day. The store hasn&#8217;t disappointed. I&#8217;ve managed to upgrade my iLife 09 to iLife 11 for just £27 (the physical package costs £45 from Apple and contains two apps which have not been updated and which I don&#8217;t care about<a href="iWeb">^2</a>. My only gripe is that I can&#8217;t trade in my previously licensed apps (such as iBank, Delicious Library 2, MarsEdit, etc) for Mac App Store versions which are upgradeable through the Mac App Store. I&#8217;d love the upgrade convenience for sure, but I&#8217;m not going to re-buy any of them just for that! I am reserving judgement when it comes to future upgrades though&#8230;<a href="My">^3</a></p>

<pre><code>* we get them for free;
* we have to pay full price for a new version;
* we have to pay an upgrade fee.

I guess time will tell. But if we get them for free it may be worth ditching old licenses for Mac App Store licenses which potentially have free updates for life. If we have to pay full price for a new version then I'll stick with the old licensing systems.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had the good fortune to listen to yet another excellent podcast from Dan Benjamin&#8217;s <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5 Studios</a> yesterday - this time the <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze">Build and Analyze</a> program Dan co-hosts with <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Arment</a> (of <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> and <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> fame).</p>

<p>The show featured a discussion on the typical work cycles of developers and fell into the mistake of re-iterating the stereotype of developers as working great in bursts of time, often late in the night. I&#8217;m not going argue much about the time frame - many developers, myself included, do work great at night time.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;m going to argue with is with the suggestion that developers write amazingly good code at this time and terrible code at other times (as suggested by Dan<a href="What">^1</a>). Unfortunately I don&#8217;t think this is necessarily true - it&#8217;s true that developers who are in the zone can churn out a lot of code when they are on a roll, but the quality of that code is not necessarily going to be high (though it could be).</p>

<p>Bugs can occur at any time, and in my opinion, when you&#8217;re on a roll there&#8217;s just as much chance of introducing bugs. In fact, I&#8217;d go so far as to say that when you&#8217;re on a roll you could be more prone to introducing bugs, because you&#8217;re thinking ahead more than you&#8217;re focused on the piece of code you&#8217;re writing right now.</p>

<p>Dan and Marco seem to agree that creativity is not something that can be done on demand, but in the end, not all software development is creative (as Marco mentioned in the podcast). Software engineering is like producing music and graphical works - there are flashes of genius which can come at unexpected times. But for the every composer who works to his own schedule, there are many more musicians who work to schedules writing jingles for adverts, music for games, music for film. For every painter, there is a graphic designer churning out a new advert, or graphics for a game, or movie special effects. For every coder who writes a sweet new algorithm for the love of it, there&#8217;s another churning out code for cash.</p>

<p>Sometimes software is art, but like any art form it can be degraded to a production line when it needs to be.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;They&#8217;re gonna be super-productive. They&#8217;re gonna write, y&#8217;know, a hundred lines of awesome code in that four hour block of time, they&#8217;re gonna fix bugs, they&#8217;re gonna get tons of stuff done. But if you try to shoehorn them into doing that work between 9 and noon, let&#8217;s say, or 9 and 1, they&#8217;re gonna write crap code. It&#8217;s gonna have tons of bugs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Setting aside the geeky shame in admitting it, I&#8217;m quite excited to see the launch of the new Mac App Store this Thursday (6th January).</p>

<h2>Excitement</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m excited about it for a number of reasons but the main reason is how it restores the process of shopping for software to the way I remember it to be. I remember the pre-Internet days of buying software - I used to take my pocket money to the local computer store and peruse the shelves for games and other software that would take my fancy.</p>

<p>The Internet revolutionised the way companies distributed software and the way consumers bought software, but to me it didn&#8217;t completely improve upon the original process. Sure, you no longer had to trudge to the shop (in inclement weather or fair) in order to see what was available. The downside was that the huge range available and the lack of a centralised distribution point made it harder to truly browse for new software.</p>

<p>The App Store changed this for iOS, and the Mac App Store will hopefully do the same for Mac OS X. I&#8217;m looking forward to being able to browse categories for new software and especially to a centralised update mechanism for software. I&#8217;m particularly interested to see how it fares with new and less experienced Mac users.</p>

<h2>Trepidation</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ll say it up front: with anything that Apple control, there&#8217;s always going to be a risk of a censored view of the world. They are already the law when it comes to iOS apps, and they will also be the same for everything sold in the Mac App Store. Thankfully, side-loading is not prohibited with OS X the way it is on iOS so developers who cannot pass Apple&#8217;s stringent controls can still offer their apps for sale through their own channels.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also concerned about how Apple are going to handle some aspects such as multi-user systems. At present I (begrudgingly) share my Macs with my wife, and when I buy a piece of software and install it, my wife is licensed to use it also. Apple have said that software bought from a Mac App Store account will be usable on other Macs tied to the same account. What they haven&#8217;t said is whether the Mac App Store account applies to the whole Mac, or if it is tied to the Apple ID only.</p>

<p>For me this could really make or break the new Mac App Store. I&#8217;ll still scour the Internet for independently licensed software rather than pay twice for 2 users to use the software on the same Mac.</p>
