![iCloud] (http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2011/06/icloud.png)
&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<p>This week Apple announced their new iCloud service, and one facet that particularly intrigued me was the availability of <em>iTunes in the Cloud</em>. I’ll let Apple describe the concept:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>With iCloud, the music you purchase in iTunes appears 
automatically on all your devices. You can also download your 
past iTunes purchases. Where you want, when you want.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seemed like it would save a lot of headaches for me. I currently keep a stash of over 100GB of MP3s; over 9000 individual tracks; over 28 hours of listening. Ripping it all was a labour of love. The files are stored on a NAS drive and I keep a copy of every song on each of my 3 Macs<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I also have a number of iOS devices to get the music onto.</p>

<p>So this is what I do every time I buy a new CD:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rip, encode and tag the CD on my Mac Pro;</li>
  <li>Copy the files to the NAS;</li>
  <li>Import the files into iTunes on my Mac Pro;</li>
  <li>Copy the files from the NAS to my Mac Mini;</li>
  <li>Import the files into iTunes on my Mac Mini;</li>
  <li>Copy the files from the NAS to my MacBook Pro;</li>
  <li>Import the files into iTunes on my MacBook Pro;</li>
  <li>Sync the files from iTunes onto my iPhone;</li>
  <li>Sync the files from iTunes onto my iPad;</li>
  <li>Relax.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we are to believe Apple’s marketing material, this should soon be simplified to the following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rip, encode and tag the CD on my Mac Pro;</li>
  <li>Copy the files to the NAS (simply as a backup);</li>
  <li>Import the files into iTunes on my Mac Pro;</li>
  <li>Allow iTunes to send info on the new files up to iCloud;</li>
  <li>Relax (while the new tracks are synced automatically to my Mac Mini, MacBook Pro, iPhone and iPad).</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, with this level of convenience I’d almost be tempted to just buy the tracks through iTunes in the first place and forget about the hassle of ordering, ripping and storing those old-fashioned CDs.</p>

<h2 id="not-so-fast">Not so fast…</h2>

<p>If you go to <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/icloud/features/">Apple’s UK iCloud page</a> there is an asterisk in the service description:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>With iCloud, the music you purchase in iTunes appears 
automatically on all your devices. You can also download your 
past iTunes purchases.* Where you want, when you want.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This asterisk informs us that the service is <em>“Starting in the US”</em>.</p>

<p>This is disappointing in itself but <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/8565587/Apples-iTunes-in-iCloud-wont-launch-in-the-UK-this-year.html">emerging reports</a> from the UK press now suggest a delay until 2012: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A spokesman for the Performing Right Society (PRS), which ensures that composers, 
songwriters and music publishers are paid for their work, told The Telegraph, that 
negotiations with Apple about ensuring rights in the UK had started but were at a 
“very early stage”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How long do these publishing companies think it is acceptable to treat their customers with such contempt? Why do they get away with treating some territories as second-class citizens?</p>

<p>I pay for my CDs the same way that someone from the US pays for their CDs. Why does the US citizen get access to that music through Apple’s iCloud service and I don’t?</p>

<p>The answer I expect is probably going to come down to some excuse about the fact that I don’t own the music I bought, I simply licensed it. I’m just not quite sure when I agreed to that license. It doesn’t say anything on the CD case. I bought the CD under the same conditions that someone in the US bought their CD under. How come their license is different?</p>

<p>For now I guess I just have to look on enviously while my US counterparts enjoy the iCloud. Hopefully the outlook will be cloudy for us in the rest of the world in the near future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I took the plunge and tried updating my iPhone 4 to iOS 5. I marvelled at the shiny new process which allows untethered activation.</p>

<p>I then got frustrated when presented with the following message:</p>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2011-06-07/phone_error.jpg" alt="iPhone error" /></p>

<p>But wait! It says on the screen that I can connect the iPhone to iTunes to activate it the old-fashioned way. Salvation!</p>

<p>And then:</p>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2011-06-07/itunes_error.png" alt="iTunes error" /></p>

<p>Great.</p>

<p>Thankfully I got it resolved by borrowing an unlocked SIM card - once inserted into the iPhone the activation server started working again. I can’t tell if it was the unlocked SIM or a coincidental re-appearance of the activation server which did the trick.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="aka-how-to-lose-1000-pounds-overnight">(aka How to lose 1000 pounds overnight)</h2>

<p>I recently decided to splurge on one of the new 2011 MacBook Pros, and am very glad I did. My 2007 MBP has served me well and I’ve been very pleased with it’s performance over the years, but there were a few reasons why I thought I could justify ditching the older model:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it was out of warranty;</li>
  <li>the fans were coming on more frequently with daily work;</li>
  <li>the battery was only lasting a paltry 2-3 hours (after 2 replacements);</li>
  <li>it was feeling a bit heavy for carrying to work every day;</li>
  <li>the 15” screen was feeling like overkill;</li>
  <li>it was taking too much room in my bag.</li>
</ul>

<p>It might seem a bit flamboyant, but I was spending about 12 hours a day on my MBP. I was carrying it to and from work 4-5 days a week. I was carting it about the house in the evening, having to find the charger, trying to keep it cool.</p>

<p>It was just becoming a lot less fun.</p>

<p>So I did <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/03/13-i7-macbook-pro-review.ars">my research</a>, got the finances in order and then went ahead and purchased the new 13” Core-i5 2011 MBP.</p>

<p>I’m now under warranty again and have a machine that can cope with my workload, and yet is not too heavy a load for me to use or carry about. I was concerned about losing the screen resolution, but it hasn’t been too bad so far (especially as I’m working attached to a monitor during the working day).</p>

<p>…unless of course, you’re in the UK<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, in which case… </p>

<h2 id="the-apple-tv-just-stayed-the-same">The Apple TV just stayed the same!</h2>

<p>With the rollout of iOS 4.3 yesterday US owners of the Apple TV found that not only do they enjoy the availability of NetFlix on their devices but they now also get access to MLB (baseball) and NBA<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> (basketball).</p>

<p>It’s great that Apple are actively working to provide extra services for these devices but it would be nice if they would try thinking about territories other than the USA.</p>

<p>To pre-empt the obvious rebuttals to this post:</p>

<ul>
  <li>yes - Apple are an American company;</li>
  <li>yes - the USA is a huge market compared to the UK;</li>
  <li>yes - licensing agreements are hard enough to negotiate in one country never mind globally;</li>
  <li>yes - baseball is hardly worth jumping up and down about.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe something better will be coming soon. Right now though, it feels that the sleek little black box under the TV holds a world of potential that’s just not being realised.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve just read two articles on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/">BBC News site</a> - one was about the imminent arrival of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12339494">another winter storm</a> in the US, and the other was about Queenslanders being told to flee the arrival of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12342031">the strongest cyclone</a> in their history.</p>

<p>This is not long after the worst flooding in Queensland’s history, mudslides in Brazil which claimed hundreds of lives, and a number of other extreme weather events which have made the international headlines. Closer to home, we’ve had the lowest winter temperatures on record - these do not compare to the devastation that has occurred elsewhere, but its an indicator that our weather is changing.</p>

<p>So is this down to climate change? Have we finally done so much damage that the apocalypse is upon us? Or is it just that these things happen, and we’re now paying more attention to it?</p>

<p>Personally I think it’s a combination of both. Talk of global warming and climate change has caused us to pay more attention to news stories about extreme weather. It has caused the media to report more than they would have previously. And the natural progress of technology means that we’re now able to receive and consume more news than ever before.</p>

<p>At the same time, there does seem to be an undeniable change in the climate (both locally and globally). Whether<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> this is down to man-made global warming, or due to natural climate cycles I could not say. All I know is that we can’t rule either out.</p>

<p>I just hope that we get used to these changes sooner rather than later, and learn to cope with them in order to spare lives.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A long time ago I stumbled across the artist <a href="http://udosson.com/">Udosson</a> through his <a href="http://soundcloud.com/udosson">SoundCloud profile</a>. I always found his music to be a perfect combination of organic sounding synths and machine-like rhythms. I’d always listened to his tracks in isolation but recently I decided to lay down some cash for his 2010 album <em>Kurz Unter Land</em> (helpfully translated as “off-shore” by the kind souls at Udosson’s label <a href="http://petite-unique.de/">Petite:Unique</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>).</p>

<p>The music itself is predominantly ambient in nature and takes in clicky percussions, swelling pads and beautiful samples. Some of it is reminiscent of Hans Zimmer’s work on the Inception soundtrack while other portions remind me of the more ambient tracks from The Aphex Twin’s Drukqs album. I really recommend that you have a listen to this material at Udosson’s <a href="http://soundcloud.com/udosson">SoundCloud profile</a> and buy it if you like it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On first sighting of Apple’s <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/airplay/">AirPlay</a> technology I was initially impressed but wasn’t sure how much it offered over their existing AirTunes facilities which I’d been using with Airport Express/Apple TV (the first one) for some time. This weekend I got to use AirPlay “properly” for the first time.</p>

<p>I wanted to listen to another of the excellent <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5 Studios</a> podcasts which I had on my iPhone. I had a few options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listen on the iPhone using headphones;</li>
  <li>Listen on the iPhone using the built-in speaker;</li>
  <li>Listen on the iPhone plugged into an external set of speakers;</li>
  <li>Listen on the Apple TV attached to the HD TV;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-problems">The problems</h2>

<p>Using headphones for the iPhone just didn’t seem like a good option - I was looking after my daughter at the time and headphones would have gotten in the way and are a very attractive proposition for someone who is still investigating this new world by sticking things in her mouth and seeing what they taste like.</p>

<p>The iPhone’s built-in speaker is reasonable, but wasn’t quite enough to overcome the volume levels exhibited in the shrieks of a 5-month old girl who has been denied another opportunity to stick a remote control into her mouth.</p>

<p>I could have plugged the iPhone into a trusty set of external speakers which would have overcome all of the pitfalls posed by my daughter. Unfortunately that meant leaving the iPhone on the other side of the room and would have denied me the comforting feeling I get when I know the Internet is always within my easy reach.</p>

<p>The final option was to forget the iPhone and instead start up my Apple TV and stick on the HD TV in order to listen to an audio-only podcast. Unfortunately our most recent electricity bill was so big that I’m still on the resulting energy efficiency kick. I really didn’t want to turn on the Apple TV (about 17W) and the HD TV (about 150W) just to listen to audio.</p>

<p>And so to the rescue comes AirPlay. In the same room I had the afore-mentioned external speakers, and an Airport Express. I fired up the iPhone and started the podcast playing then selected the Airport Express as the target for the audio. After a small delay (about a second) Dan Benjamin’s voice was coming out of my speakers.</p>

<p>I still had the iPhone in hand and could surf at will. I could hear the podcast over my daughter’s vocal contributions. I was saving money by not using the TV wastefully.</p>

<p>That’s why I say “Mmm AirPlay I Love You”.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love <a href="http://www.macstories.net/">MacStories</a> and just about everything that Federico Viticci writes, but I have to disagree with some aspects of this post defending <a href="http://www.sophiestication.com/">Sophiestication</a> and the <a href="http://www.sophiestication.com/coversutra/">CoverSutra</a> debacle.</p>

<p>Firstly I agree with Federico - verbally abusing the developer is not necessary and is completely wrong.</p>

<p>Where I disagree is when Federico alludes that this situation was a by-product of the Mac App Store policies: <em>“I believe Sophia is yet another victim of Apple’s policy when it comes to the Mac App Store, and she’s just being accused first.”</em> The problem with CoverSutra was not the transition to the Mac App Store or it’s policies but is actually with the fact that Sophia (the developer of CoverSutra) decided to cut off her existing customers.</p>

<p>Sophia chose to move to the Mac App Store exclusively and to not maintain two builds. She fell victim to her own policy and not to Apple’s. Sure, she may have forgotten about the promise she made, but she should consider herself reminded.</p>

<p>I get the fact that as a small developer the overhead of maintaining two builds is not to be easily absorbed, but she made the choice to ditch one of those builds. Unfortunately she chose the one that her existing customers paid for her to use until she delivered on the free upgrade to version 3.0 that she promised.</p>

<p>I feel for Sophia, cause she has a big decision now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Stick with the Mac App Store, alienate her existing customers and tarnish her reputation, in the hope that new customers through the Mac App Store can overcome the setbacks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Revert to two builds - an overhead sure, but maybe less costly than the hit to her reputation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Either of these options is going to cost her and her company to some extent. Personally, I think she should take the second option - the Internet community can be a cruel and unforgiving bunch.</p>

<p>One more thing - Federico wrote <em>“I think this is a problem of self-entitlement with some users”</em> - maybe it is, maybe it’s not. These users feel that they paid for free upgrades up to an including version 3.0. Is this what Sophia sold?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> If so, then surely it’s not self-entitlement for people to expect what they paid for.</p>

      <p>I didn’t buy CoverSutra so I don’t know how the free upgrades came about - were they advertised as such in the sales blurb, or was it an afterthought?<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
