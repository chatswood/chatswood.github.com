  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I took the plunge and tried updating my iPhone 4 to iOS 5. I marvelled at the shiny new process which allows untethered activation.</p>

<p>I then got frustrated when presented with the following message:</p>

<p>But wait! It says on the screen that I can connect the iPhone to iTunes to activate it the old-fashioned way. Salvation!</p>

<p>And then:</p>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2011-06-07/itunes_error.png" alt="iTunes error" /></p>

<p>Great.</p>

<p>Thankfully I got it resolved by borrowing an unlocked SIM card - once inserted into the iPhone the activation server started working again. I can’t tell if it was the unlocked SIM or a coincidental re-appearance of the activation server which did the trick.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="aka-how-to-lose-1000-pounds-overnight">(aka How to lose 1000 pounds overnight)</h2>

<p>I recently decided to splurge on one of the new 2011 MacBook Pros, and am very glad I did. My 2007 MBP has served me well and I’ve been very pleased with it’s performance over the years, but there were a few reasons why I thought I could justify ditching the older model:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it was out of warranty;</li>
  <li>the fans were coming on more frequently with daily work;</li>
  <li>the battery was only lasting a paltry 2-3 hours (after 2 replacements);</li>
  <li>it was feeling a bit heavy for carrying to work every day;</li>
  <li>the 15” screen was feeling like overkill;</li>
  <li>it was taking too much room in my bag.</li>
</ul>

<p>It might seem a bit flamboyant, but I was spending about 12 hours a day on my MBP. I was carrying it to and from work 4-5 days a week. I was carting it about the house in the evening, having to find the charger, trying to keep it cool.</p>

<p>It was just becoming a lot less fun.</p>

<p>So I did <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/03/13-i7-macbook-pro-review.ars">my research</a>, got the finances in order and then went ahead and purchased the new 13” Core-i5 2011 MBP.</p>

<p>I’m now under warranty again and have a machine that can cope with my workload, and yet is not too heavy a load for me to use or carry about. I was concerned about losing the screen resolution, but it hasn’t been too bad so far (especially as I’m working attached to a monitor during the working day).</p>

<p>…unless of course, you’re in the UK<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, in which case… </p>

<h2 id="the-apple-tv-just-stayed-the-same">The Apple TV just stayed the same!</h2>

<p>With the rollout of iOS 4.3 yesterday US owners of the Apple TV found that not only do they enjoy the availability of NetFlix on their devices but they now also get access to MLB (baseball) and NBA<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> (basketball).</p>

<p>It’s great that Apple are actively working to provide extra services for these devices but it would be nice if they would try thinking about territories other than the USA.</p>

<p>To pre-empt the obvious rebuttals to this post:</p>

<ul>
  <li>yes - Apple are an American company;</li>
  <li>yes - the USA is a huge market compared to the UK;</li>
  <li>yes - licensing agreements are hard enough to negotiate in one country never mind globally;</li>
  <li>yes - baseball is hardly worth jumping up and down about.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe something better will be coming soon. Right now though, it feels that the sleek little black box under the TV holds a world of potential that’s just not being realised.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve just read two articles on the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/">BBC News site</a> - one was about the imminent arrival of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12339494">another winter storm</a> in the US, and the other was about Queenslanders being told to flee the arrival of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12342031">the strongest cyclone</a> in their history.</p>

<p>This is not long after the worst flooding in Queensland’s history, mudslides in Brazil which claimed hundreds of lives, and a number of other extreme weather events which have made the international headlines. Closer to home, we’ve had the lowest winter temperatures on record - these do not compare to the devastation that has occurred elsewhere, but its an indicator that our weather is changing.</p>

<p>So is this down to climate change? Have we finally done so much damage that the apocalypse is upon us? Or is it just that these things happen, and we’re now paying more attention to it?</p>

<p>Personally I think it’s a combination of both. Talk of global warming and climate change has caused us to pay more attention to news stories about extreme weather. It has caused the media to report more than they would have previously. And the natural progress of technology means that we’re now able to receive and consume more news than ever before.</p>

<p>At the same time, there does seem to be an undeniable change in the climate (both locally and globally). Whether<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> this is down to man-made global warming, or due to natural climate cycles I could not say. All I know is that we can’t rule either out.</p>

<p>I just hope that we get used to these changes sooner rather than later, and learn to cope with them in order to spare lives.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A long time ago I stumbled across the artist <a href="http://udosson.com/">Udosson</a> through his <a href="http://soundcloud.com/udosson">SoundCloud profile</a>. I always found his music to be a perfect combination of organic sounding synths and machine-like rhythms. I’d always listened to his tracks in isolation but recently I decided to lay down some cash for his 2010 album <em>Kurz Unter Land</em> (helpfully translated as “off-shore” by the kind souls at Udosson’s label <a href="http://petite-unique.de/">Petite:Unique</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>).</p>

<p>The music itself is predominantly ambient in nature and takes in clicky percussions, swelling pads and beautiful samples. Some of it is reminiscent of Hans Zimmer’s work on the Inception soundtrack while other portions remind me of the more ambient tracks from The Aphex Twin’s Drukqs album. I really recommend that you have a listen to this material at Udosson’s <a href="http://soundcloud.com/udosson">SoundCloud profile</a> and buy it if you like it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On first sighting of Apple’s <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/airplay/">AirPlay</a> technology I was initially impressed but wasn’t sure how much it offered over their existing AirTunes facilities which I’d been using with Airport Express/Apple TV (the first one) for some time. This weekend I got to use AirPlay “properly” for the first time.</p>

<p>I wanted to listen to another of the excellent <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5 Studios</a> podcasts which I had on my iPhone. I had a few options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listen on the iPhone using headphones;</li>
  <li>Listen on the iPhone using the built-in speaker;</li>
  <li>Listen on the iPhone plugged into an external set of speakers;</li>
  <li>Listen on the Apple TV attached to the HD TV;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-problems">The problems</h2>

<p>Using headphones for the iPhone just didn’t seem like a good option - I was looking after my daughter at the time and headphones would have gotten in the way and are a very attractive proposition for someone who is still investigating this new world by sticking things in her mouth and seeing what they taste like.</p>

<p>The iPhone’s built-in speaker is reasonable, but wasn’t quite enough to overcome the volume levels exhibited in the shrieks of a 5-month old girl who has been denied another opportunity to stick a remote control into her mouth.</p>

<p>I could have plugged the iPhone into a trusty set of external speakers which would have overcome all of the pitfalls posed by my daughter. Unfortunately that meant leaving the iPhone on the other side of the room and would have denied me the comforting feeling I get when I know the Internet is always within my easy reach.</p>

<p>The final option was to forget the iPhone and instead start up my Apple TV and stick on the HD TV in order to listen to an audio-only podcast. Unfortunately our most recent electricity bill was so big that I’m still on the resulting energy efficiency kick. I really didn’t want to turn on the Apple TV (about 17W) and the HD TV (about 150W) just to listen to audio.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>

<p>And so to the rescue comes AirPlay. In the same room I had the afore-mentioned external speakers, and an Airport Express. I fired up the iPhone and started the podcast playing then selected the Airport Express as the target for the audio. After a small delay (about a second) Dan Benjamin’s voice was coming out of my speakers.</p>

<p>I still had the iPhone in hand and could surf at will. I could hear the podcast over my daughter’s vocal contributions. I was saving money by not using the TV wastefully.</p>

<p>That’s why I say “Mmm AirPlay I Love You”.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>For those that get it, good, for those who don’t this is a play on the excellent tune “Mmm Skyscraper I Love You” by Underworld from their Dubnobasswithmyheadman album. If you don’t own it, you should.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love <a href="http://www.macstories.net/">MacStories</a> and just about everything that Federico Viticci writes, but I have to disagree with some aspects of this post defending <a href="http://www.sophiestication.com/">Sophiestication</a> and the <a href="http://www.sophiestication.com/coversutra/">CoverSutra</a> debacle.</p>

<p>Firstly I agree with Federico - verbally abusing the developer is not necessary and is completely wrong.</p>

<p>Where I disagree is when Federico alludes that this situation was a by-product of the Mac App Store policies: <em>“I believe Sophia is yet another victim of Apple’s policy when it comes to the Mac App Store, and she’s just being accused first.”</em> The problem with CoverSutra was not the transition to the Mac App Store or it’s policies but is actually with the fact that Sophia (the developer of CoverSutra) decided to cut off her existing customers.</p>

<p>Sophia chose to move to the Mac App Store exclusively and to not maintain two builds. She fell victim to her own policy and not to Apple’s. Sure, she may have forgotten about the promise she made, but she should consider herself reminded.</p>

<p>I get the fact that as a small developer the overhead of maintaining two builds is not to be easily absorbed, but she made the choice to ditch one of those builds. Unfortunately she chose the one that her existing customers paid for her to use until she delivered on the free upgrade to version 3.0 that she promised.</p>

<p>I feel for Sophia, cause she has a big decision now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Stick with the Mac App Store, alienate her existing customers and tarnish her reputation, in the hope that new customers through the Mac App Store can overcome the setbacks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Revert to two builds - an overhead sure, but maybe less costly than the hit to her reputation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Either of these options is going to cost her and her company to some extent. Personally, I think she should take the second option - the Internet community can be a cruel and unforgiving bunch.</p>

<p>One more thing - Federico wrote <em>“I think this is a problem of self-entitlement with some users”</em> - maybe it is, maybe it’s not. These users feel that they paid for free upgrades up to an including version 3.0. Is this what Sophia sold?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> If so, then surely it’s not self-entitlement for people to expect what they paid for.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>I didn’t buy CoverSutra so I don’t know how the free upgrades came about - were they advertised as such in the sales blurb, or was it an afterthought?<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So the <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/">Mac App Store</a> has launched and there doesn’t appear to have been any major disasters.</p>

<p>Much to my relief it has been possible to purchase a paid app (e.g. the new <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/imovie/id408981434?mt=12">iMovie 11</a>) and not only install it on my user account on another Mac, but also to use it in my wife’s user account on both Macs. This was my big concern which seems to have been unfounded. However, it’s early days yet and by all accounts not all developers have been properly checking receipts so far which means the situation could change. I’m feeling fairly confident given that I’ve tested it with Apple’s own offerings.</p>

<h2 id="available-apps">Available apps</h2>

<p>The range of apps available so far is quite small in comparison to the “free market” and the iOS App Store, but that’s only to be expected. The pleasant surprise was to see so many familiar names like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/omnifocus-for-mac/id402835630?mt=12">OmniFocus</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/marsedit/id402376225?mt=12">MarsEdit</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ibank/id402422773?mt=12">iBank</a>, as well as the expected Apple favourites like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewRoom?fcId=412904350&amp;mt=12&amp;id=29562.">iWork</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewRoom?fcId=412904253&amp;mt=12&amp;id=29562">iLife 11</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest surprise for me was the fact that <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/aperture/id408981426?mt=12">Aperture</a> is selling through the Mac App Store for just £44.99. Given that Apple are still selling the boxed version<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> for £173 through the Apple Store it’s an amazing deal. Given the prices I’ve paid since Aperture 1.5 (£220 + £79 for the 2.0 upgrade + £79 for the 3.0 upgrade!) it smarts slightly, but it’s great to see the price point reduce for an invaluable tool, and hopefully it will drive uptake and lead to renewed vigour on the applications development.</p>

<h2 id="confusion">Confusion</h2>

<p>It’s not all been plain sailing. There’s a bit of confusion out there about the fact that the Mac App Store application detects your previously licensed software as being installed. It’s not clear if this is a bug or intentional, but it is causing people to ask the question <em>“If the Mac App Store can tell that I have the software installed, can it update it for me?”</em> The answer is made pretty clear at this site: <a href="http://ifiboughtyourappalreadycaniupdateitthroughthemacappstore.com/">http://ifiboughtyourappalreadycaniupdateitthroughthemacappstore.com/</a> Basically the apps are detected as installed because they share the same bundle ID. Unfortunately they are usually different builds[^1.5] of the software which just report themselves to be the same. In short - unless you bought it through the Mac App Store, you can’t update it through the Mac App Store.</p>

<p>There’s also no way to uninstall apps through this new interface. While it’s still as easy to remove apps by dragging them to the trash, it’s not the polished solution I was hoping for. One of the obvious reasons for the Mac App Store was the fact that it reduced the hell that .dmg files could be for inexperienced users. Job done, but it still doesn’t make it any easier for the same users to remove software that they no longer want (especially as the Mac App Store makes it so much easier to download free and cheap apps to clutter our /Applications folder).</p>

<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>

<p>It’s been a good day. The store hasn’t disappointed. I’ve managed to upgrade my iLife 09 to iLife 11 for just £27 (the physical package costs £45 from Apple and contains two apps which have not been updated and which I don’t care about<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. My only gripe is that I can’t trade in my previously licensed apps (such as iBank, Delicious Library 2, MarsEdit, etc) for Mac App Store versions which are upgradeable through the Mac App Store. I’d love the upgrade convenience for sure, but I’m not going to re-buy any of them just for that! I am reserving judgement when it comes to future upgrades though…<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

      <p>I say boxed version, but it’s not even a particularly big box anymore. It comes with a DVD-ROM and a few little booklets. Not worth the price difference.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>iWeb and iDVD.<a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>My thinking here is this: upgrades on iOS are always free. I’ve not seen any details on the Mac App Store about what will happen with upgrades - I see three broad options:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>we get them for free;</li>
        <li>we have to pay full price for a new version;</li>
        <li>we have to pay an upgrade fee.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I guess time will tell. But if we get them for free it may be worth ditching old licenses for Mac App Store licenses which potentially have free updates for life. If we have to pay full price for a new version then I’ll stick with the old licensing systems.<a href="#fnref:3" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had the good fortune to listen to yet another excellent podcast from Dan Benjamin’s <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5 Studios</a> yesterday - this time the <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze">Build and Analyze</a> program Dan co-hosts with <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Arment</a> (of <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> and <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> fame).</p>

<p>The show featured a discussion on the typical work cycles of developers and fell into the mistake of re-iterating the stereotype of developers as working great in bursts of time, often late in the night. I’m not going argue much about the time frame - many developers, myself included, do work great at night time.</p>

<p>What I’m going to argue with is with the suggestion that developers write amazingly good code at this time and terrible code at other times (as suggested by Dan<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>). Unfortunately I don’t think this is necessarily true - it’s true that developers who are in the zone can churn out a lot of code when they are on a roll, but the quality of that code is not necessarily going to be high (though it could be).</p>

<p>Bugs can occur at any time, and in my opinion, when you’re on a roll there’s just as much chance of introducing bugs. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that when you’re on a roll you could be more prone to introducing bugs, because you’re thinking ahead more than you’re focused on the piece of code you’re writing right now.</p>

<p>Dan and Marco seem to agree that creativity is not something that can be done on demand, but in the end, not all software development is creative (as Marco mentioned in the podcast). Software engineering is like producing music and graphical works - there are flashes of genius which can come at unexpected times. But for the every composer who works to his own schedule, there are many more musicians who work to schedules writing jingles for adverts, music for games, music for film. For every painter, there is a graphic designer churning out a new advert, or graphics for a game, or movie special effects. For every coder who writes a sweet new algorithm for the love of it, there’s another churning out code for cash.</p>

<p>Sometimes software is art, but like any art form it can be degraded to a production line when it needs to be.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“They’re gonna be super-productive. They’re gonna write, y’know, a hundred lines of awesome code in that four hour block of time, they’re gonna fix bugs, they’re gonna get tons of stuff done. But if you try to shoehorn them into doing that work between 9 and noon, let’s say, or 9 and 1, they’re gonna write crap code. It’s gonna have tons of bugs.”</p>
</blockquote>
