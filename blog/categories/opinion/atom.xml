    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So… Apple paid U2 a lot of money to give away a copy of their latest album. The reasoning behind this has been discussed at length across the Internet and I could only speculate as to why either party did it. So I won’t.</p>

<p>The bigger controversy is the fact that Apple put a copy of the album into the purchase history  of every iTunes customer, which resulted in an automatic download of the album for many people. This also has been debated at length, and nobody really needs me to add another voice to the mix. So I won’t.</p>

<p>I was going to pass on this topic until I saw the following tweet written by Peter Cohen – a writer and managing editor at iMore, an Apple-centric news web site.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I’m ambivalent about U2, but if you have actual rage that the album was added to your iTunes library, I think you’re mentally ill.</p>&mdash; Peter Cohen (@flargh) <a href="https://twitter.com/flargh/status/510206557632868352">September 11, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I personally objected to Peter using the term “mentally ill” in this context. I thought about how I should send a scathing response, which is hard to do effectively in 140 characters or less, criticising Peter for equating general “rage” with mental illness, but I figured it was just a poorly worded, throwaway comment that wasn’t worth getting annoyed about. So I didn’t.</p>

<p>Then I saw his article about the subject on iMore, <a href="http://www.imore.com/nsfw-apple-u2-and-looking-gift-horse-mouth">“NSFW: Apple, U2 and looking a gift horse in the mouth”</a>. While I don’t necessarily agree with his position on the whole subject, I once again was dismayed to see a reference to mental illness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the inordinate amount of actual anger directed at Apple and U2 over this is so disproportional to the actual event, I’ve started to wonder about the mental state of some of those complaining. It’s really been off the charts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve tried looking at it from Peter’s point of view, and I get that he has seen some people take this issue way too seriously. As with any broad cross-section of people, you can expect a wide spectrum of reactions, possibly ranging from ecstatic pleasure at receiving a free album by their favourite band of all time, to people who are – rightly or wrongly – angry, or raging, at what they see as a violation of their privacy.</p>

<p>Peter doesn’t get why people would be so angry. That’s fine. He wants to write about it. That’s fine also.</p>

<p>What’s not fine is conflating Internet rage (however extreme it may seem) with mental illness. It’s a cheap shot. It’s also quite disappointing given how much the tech industry has been pushing towards greater awareness of mental illness, and striving to reduce the stigma that has made it hard for people to seek help. Using a perception of mental instability to deride people you disagree with is not the way to bring mental health issues to the fore.</p>

<p>As someone who suffers from mental health issues, I felt I should say something about this, and  do my part to not let people think it’s okay to equate rage with mental health problems. So I did.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.chatswood.org.uk/blog/2013/08/18/deluxe-upgrades-in-itunes/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-18T09:20:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.chatswood.org.uk/blog/2013/08/18/deluxe-upgrades-in-itunes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, <a href="http://thepresets.com/">The Presets</a> – one of my favourite bands – <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePresets/status/368226816122556416">announced the imminent UK availability</a> of the “Deluxe/Expanded” edition of their <a href="http://pacifica.thepresets.com/">Pacifica album</a>.</p>

<p>As a fan, one of the most infuriating aspects of the music industry is the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_edition">Deluxe Version</a></em>. Some deluxe editions are re-releases many years later and contain “features” such as remastered tracks, expanded liner notes, and extra material. Other special editions are re-releases that come mere months after the original, usually offering a bunch of extra tracks and little else. In the case of Pacifica, the deluxe edition comes twelve months after the initial release with a bunch of remixes.</p>

<p>I’m a compulsive music buyer, and I love to buy music by my favourite bands on the day they get released. An unfortunate side-effect of being a dedicated fan is that loyalty is not rewarded by the release of a deluxe edition. The dedicated fan gets what amounts to an inferior product, and an “opportunity” to buy much of the same material again. When it came to physical discs, buying the original CD again just to get a few extra tracks was simply not an option. So in the past, I just grumbled to myself and got on with it.</p>

<h2 id="a-digital-upgrade">A Digital Upgrade</h2>

<p>These days I buy music from iTunes, where tracks can be bought individually and albums can theoretically be upgraded. Re-releasing an album as a deluxe edition could be a case of adding a bunch of tracks to the existing album, and allowing previous purchasers to <em>add</em> the new material at an additional (but discounted!) cost. I’m not saying we should just get them for free, I just feel that we should get an opportunity to get the same tracklisting as a new purchaser, without having to pay double (or potentially more than double).</p>

<p>This is completely feasible in this day and age. In fact, when I view the new <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/pacifica-deluxe-version/id687410130">deluxe edition of Pacifica on iTunes</a> it actually shows that I have purchased the original album tracks.</p>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2013/08/presets-deluxe-edition-on-itunes.png" alt="Pacifica Deluxe Edition on iTunes showing previously Purchased tracks" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately I can’t simply buy the additional material – the entire Deluxe Edition is marked as Album Only. Even if they could be purchased separately it would actually cost more to buy the additional 12 tracks at 79p each than to buy the Deluxe Edition as a whole.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-want">What I Want</h2>

<p>I’d like to make it clear that I don’t blame The Presets, and am only mentioning them specifically as they were an example that triggered this post. It happens with deluxe editions from many artists, and in my opinion this falls squarely at the feet of the record companies and Apple/iTunes.</p>

<p>The record companies like to put out deluxe editions to bolster sales and extract more money from previous purchasers. They did it with physical discs and they are continuing the practice into the digital download age as well. </p>

<p>Apple/iTunes should be making more of an effort to allow “upgrading” to a deluxe edition. iTunes already has the facility to allow a customer to buy a few individual tracks from an album, then “upgrade” to the full album for the difference in price. A deluxe upgrade price could be set and purchasers of the original album could be offered a nominal upgrade price rather than being fleeced for the entire album again.</p>

<p>If iTunes provided this facility, and/or record companies treated the fans with a little less contempt, then it’s likely to be a win for everyone. Superfans don’t feel like they are being fleeced, bands can release deluxe editions without feeling like they are taking advantage of their fans, and the music industry could probably make more money from many “upgrades” than from the lower number of fans who would re-buy the entire album.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve seen a lot of positive discussion in the developer community recently about depression and mental illness. People are standing up to say they have suffered from depression and that it is nothing to be ashamed of. This is good.</p>

<p>My only concern is that developers (being developers) have a tendency to try to fix things themselves. A developer spots a bug, spends a bit of time trying to root cause it, and then applies a fix. This is also good, in a development setting, but it’s not so good when dealing with what’s going on inside your own head.</p>

<p>If you’re feeling the <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Depression/Pages/Symptoms.aspx">symptoms of depression</a>, then for your own sake talk to a friend or, better yet, go and see a professional. You might be a great developer but you are an amateur when it comes to understanding <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0596517785/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0596517785&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chatswood-21">how your own brain works</a>. If you try to internalize it you are more likely to do yourself more harm than good.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.chatswood.org.uk/blog/2013/06/08/vesper/"/>
    <updated>2013-06-08T13:48:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.chatswood.org.uk/blog/2013/06/08/vesper</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://vesperapp.co/">Vesper is a new note-taking app</a> from Q Branch, a company comprised of the engineering talents of Brent Simmons, the design talents of Dave Wiskus, and the directorial talents of John Gruber.</p>

<p>So far opinion seems to be divided – many Apple bloggers are hailing it as the greatest thing since sliced bread, whereas many of the regular developers that I know or follow on some form of social media are of the opinion that it is over-priced and under-featured in an already saturated market segment.</p>

<p>Much of my own opinion on the matter can be summarised by <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/">Dr. Drang</a>’s <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/06/form-and-function/">take: “Form and Function”</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s a thought experiment: Imagine a new note-taking app written by an unknown developer. It’s has a nice, clean look and is easy to use, but it has no syncing, no TextExpander support, and no URL scheme. Assuming the app got any attention at all, how much effort would Apple bloggers put into defending that design choice? How often would the phrase “data silo” be used?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I’m a little jealous of the guys behind Q Branch. There, I’ve said it. As an iOS developer it smarts a little to see them get such acclaim for what is, by modern standards, a well designed but feature lacking app.</p>

<p>But what irks most is that this is symptomatic of much of what goes on in the Apple community these days. We have promoted certain individuals to the status of idols. We hang off their every word, we repeat their opinions in a parrot-like fashion, and we judge their work without the same level of criticism that we would apply to mere mortals.</p>

<p>We as a community need to stop this, otherwise we’re just the ‘fanbois’ we’ve always been derided for being.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.chatswood.org.uk/blog/2012/10/23/netbot-the-app-dot-net-saviour/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-23T14:51:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.chatswood.org.uk/blog/2012/10/23/netbot-the-app-dot-net-saviour</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/20/">latest episode</a> of <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a>, host John Gruber commented with regard to App.net and the release of <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/netbot/">Netbot</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s been a great little science experiment since Netbot came out about the importance of apps versus web clients”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gruber, and his guest Brent Simmons, said a lot of sensible things in this discussion, but the implication here is that App.net was treading water prior to the release of Netbot because there were no native clients.</p>

<p>Many App.net users will be well aware that Netbot was not the first native iOS client to be unleashed. There were numerous native clients for iOS available prior to this (I personally used AppApp, <a href="http://tigerbears.com/felix/">Felix</a>, <a href="http://www.appnetrhino.com/">Rhino</a> and <a href="http://www.rivrapp.com/">Rivr</a>) so the native client requisite for success was already satisfied. The real reason why App.net usage took off after the release of Netbot was more likely due to a large volume of subscribers (existing and potential) who were too timid to truly embrace the platform until a big-name client was launched. </p>

<p>I’m glad that the release of Netbot for iOS gave a much needed boost to the App.net population and I hope we see a similar boost when Netbot for Mac is released. I’d also like to see some acknowledgement given to the original native clients who put in the hard yards in the early days. After all it was they who helped cultivate the existing population that made it viable for a bigger developer like Tapbots to invest in the platform.</p>
