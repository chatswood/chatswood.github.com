    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, <a href="http://thepresets.com/">The Presets</a> – one of my favourite bands – <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePresets/status/368226816122556416">announced the imminent UK availability</a> of the “Deluxe/Expanded” edition of their <a href="http://pacifica.thepresets.com/">Pacifica album</a>.</p>

<p>As a fan, one of the most infuriating aspects of the music industry is the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_edition">Deluxe Version</a></em>. Some deluxe editions are re-releases many years later and contain “features” such as remastered tracks, expanded liner notes, and extra material. Other special editions are re-releases that come mere months after the original, usually offering a bunch of extra tracks and little else. In the case of Pacifica, the deluxe edition comes twelve months after the initial release with a bunch of remixes.</p>

<p>I’m a compulsive music buyer, and I love to buy music by my favourite bands on the day they get released. An unfortunate side-effect of being a dedicated fan is that loyalty is not rewarded by the release of a deluxe edition. The dedicated fan gets what amounts to an inferior product, and an “opportunity” to buy much of the same material again. When it came to physical discs, buying the original CD again just to get a few extra tracks was simply not an option. So in the past, I just grumbled to myself and got on with it.</p>

<h2 id="a-digital-upgrade">A Digital Upgrade</h2>

<p>These days I buy music from iTunes, where tracks can be bought individually and albums can theoretically be upgraded. Re-releasing an album as a deluxe edition could be a case of adding a bunch of tracks to the existing album, and allowing previous purchasers to <em>add</em> the new material at an additional (but discounted!) cost. I’m not saying we should just get them for free, I just feel that we should get an opportunity to get the same tracklisting as a new purchaser, without having to pay double (or potentially more than double).</p>

<p>This is completely feasible in this day and age. In fact, when I view the new <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/pacifica-deluxe-version/id687410130">deluxe edition of Pacifica on iTunes</a> it actually shows that I have purchased the original album tracks.</p>

<p><img src="http://content.chatswood.org.uk/photo/2013/08/presets-deluxe-edition-on-itunes.png" alt="Pacifica Deluxe Edition on iTunes showing previously Purchased tracks" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately I can’t simply buy the additional material – the entire Deluxe Edition is marked as Album Only. Even if they could be purchased separately it would actually cost more to buy the additional 12 tracks at 79p each than to buy the Deluxe Edition as a whole.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-want">What I Want</h2>

<p>I’d like to make it clear that I don’t blame The Presets, and am only mentioning them specifically as they were an example that triggered this post. It happens with deluxe editions from many artists, and in my opinion this falls squarely at the feet of the record companies and Apple/iTunes.</p>

<p>The record companies like to put out deluxe editions to bolster sales and extract more money from previous purchasers. They did it with physical discs and they are continuing the practice into the digital download age as well. </p>

<p>Apple/iTunes should be making more of an effort to allow “upgrading” to a deluxe edition. iTunes already has the facility to allow a customer to buy a few individual tracks from an album, then “upgrade” to the full album for the difference in price. A deluxe upgrade price could be set and purchasers of the original album could be offered a nominal upgrade price rather than being fleeced for the entire album again.</p>

<p>If iTunes provided this facility, and/or record companies treated the fans with a little less contempt, then it’s likely to be a win for everyone. Superfans don’t feel like they are being fleeced, bands can release deluxe editions without feeling like they are taking advantage of their fans, and the music industry could probably make more money from many “upgrades” than from the lower number of fans who would re-buy the entire album.</p>

    <updated>2012-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.chatswood.org.uk/post/19177041938/you-want-how-much</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I made the decision recently that I was going to stop buying physical media and make digital purchases <em>where possible</em>. By <em>where possible</em> I mean that I will buy the digital media under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when I can not buy a physical CD for a reasonable price;</li>
  <li>when I can get the digital media in a lossless format<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The new album from Vince Clarke and Martin Gore (collectively known as <a href="http://www.facebook.com/VCMGofficial">VCMG</a>) was released today. I figured this was a good opportunity to try the new purchasing strategy and I decided to hop over to the <a href="http://mute.com/artists/vcmg">artist’s page</a> on mute.com to see about where to grab some digital goodness.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> <br />
The obvious place to look is the mute.com store. A quick search for VCMG reveals that they have a <em>“Digital Album”</em> for sale. And only £6.99. I click the link, and see that the format is 320kbps MP3s. That’s not what I’m looking for. Back to the artist page to try again.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong><br />
While on the artist page, I notice a mention of VCMG’s previous EP being available on <a href="http://www.beatport.com/">Beatport</a>. Beatport is a site I’ve used before and has a good range of electronic and dance music. I head over there and search for VCMG. Result. It says £7.65 for the whole album so I add it to my basket. Hmmm, now there’s VAT added. £8.80. Not so good. And it’s only MP3. There is an option to upgrade to WAV but at a cost of £1 per track! THis brings the total cost to £20.30. I’ll try elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong><br />
I head to Google and search for <em>vcmg ssss wav</em> and find the second result is Juno Download. They’re upfront about pricing and show the options: 192kbps MP3, 320kbps MP3 and WAV. Their prices are fairly competitive for MP3s, but they still attract a £5.00 premium for WAV bringing the total price to £10.99. At nearly half the price of Beatport it is certainly an improvement, but it’s not what I’d hoped for.</p>

<p>I do some more googling around using search terms such as <em>“vcmg ssss wav”</em>, <em>“vcmg ssss lossless”</em>, <em>“vcmg ssss flac”</em>. Much of what comes back is in the form of illegal torrents, so I decide to throw in the search modifier <em>“-torrent”</em>. Still I get mostly illegal download sources.</p>

<p>This dancing around the web has become boring now so I go old-school on the problem. I hit up Amazon and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B006XABLAE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=chatswood-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B006XABLAE">bought the physical CD from there</a>. For £8.99 I get the physical media and the ability to make FLAC and MP3 files from it. It’s annoying, but it’s still the best value out there.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>For now my preferred formats are WAV or FLAC. WAV files will be converted to FLAC for long term storage and the WAV files subsequently discarded.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <updated>2011-01-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.chatswood.org.uk/post/2924445483/udosson-kurz-unter-land</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A long time ago I stumbled across the artist <a href="http://udosson.com/">Udosson</a> through his <a href="http://soundcloud.com/udosson">SoundCloud profile</a>. I always found his music to be a perfect combination of organic sounding synths and machine-like rhythms. I’d always listened to his tracks in isolation but recently I decided to lay down some cash for his 2010 album <em>Kurz Unter Land</em> (helpfully translated as “off-shore” by the kind souls at Udosson’s label <a href="http://petite-unique.de/">Petite:Unique</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>).</p>

<p>The music itself is predominantly ambient in nature and takes in clicky percussions, swelling pads and beautiful samples. Some of it is reminiscent of Hans Zimmer’s work on the Inception soundtrack while other portions remind me of the more ambient tracks from The Aphex Twin’s Drukqs album. I really recommend that you have a listen to this material at Udosson’s <a href="http://soundcloud.com/udosson">SoundCloud profile</a> and buy it if you like it.</p>

      <p>Nice people but I hope they get a better payment mechanism together soon.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
